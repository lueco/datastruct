jeanne madrid and the staff at casa de vidamay you keep the spirit contents diving under flipped buddy beware the sycamore tree brawkbrawkbrawk the eggs get a grip man the yard looming large and smelly the visit the serious willies the dinner flipped the basket boys diving under all ive ever wanted is for juli baker to leave me alone for her to back off you know just give me some space it all started the summer before second grade when our moving van pulled into her neighborhood and since were now about done with the eighth grade that my friend makes more than half a decade of strategic avoidance and social discomfort she didnt just barge into my life she barged and shoved and wedged her way into my life did we invite her to get into our moving van and start climbing all over boxes no but thats exactly what she did taking over and showing off like only juli baker can my dad tried to stop her hey he says as shes catapulting herself on board what are you doing youre getting mud everywhere so true too her shoes were like caked with the stuff she didnt hop out though instead she planted her rear end on the floor and started pushing a big box with her feet dont you want some help she glanced my way it sure looks like you need it i didnt like the implication and even though my dad had been tossing me the same sort of look all week i could tell he didnt like this girl either hey dont do that he warned her there are some really valuable things in that box oh well how about this one she scoots over to a box labeled lenox and looks my way again we should push it together no no no my dad says then pulls her up by the arm why dont you run along home your mothers probably wondering where you are this was the beginning of my soontobecomeacute awareness that the girl cannot take a hint of any kind does she zip on home like a kid should when theyve been invited to leave no she says oh my mom knows where i am she said it was fine then she points across the street and says we just live right over there my father looks to where shes pointing and mutters oh boy then he looks at me and winks as he says bryce isnt it time for you to go inside and help your mother i knew right off that this was a ditch play and i didnt think about it until later but ditch wasnt a play id run with my dad before face it pulling a ditch is not something discussed with dads its like against parental law to tell your kid its okay to ditch someone no matter how annoying or muddy they might be but there he was putting the play in motion and man he didnt have to wink twice i smiled and said sure thing then jumped off the liftgate and headed for my new front door i heard her coming after me but i couldnt believe it maybe it just sounded like she was chasing me maybe she was really going the other way but before i got up the nerve to look she blasted right past me grabbing my arm and yanking me along this was too much i planted myself and was about to tell her to get lost when the weirdest thing happened i was making this big windmill motion to break away from her but somehow on the downswing my hand wound up tangling into hers i couldnt believe it there i was holding the mud monkeys hand i tried to shake her off but she just clamped on tight and yanked me along saying cmon my mom came out of the house and immediately got the worlds sappiest look on her face well hello she says to juli hi im still trying to pull free but the girls got me in a death grip my moms grinning looking at our hands and my fiery red face and whats your name honey julianna baker i live right over there she says pointing with her unoccupied hand well i see youve met my son she says still grinning away uhhuh finally i break free and do the only manly thing available when youre seven years old i dive behind my mother mom puts her arm around me and says bryce honey why dont you show julianna around the house i flash her help and warning signals with every part of my body but shes not receiving then she shakes me off and says go on juli wouldve tramped right in if my mother hadnt noticed her shoes and told her to take them off and after those were off my mom told her that

her dirty socks had to go too juli wasnt embarrassed not a bit she just peeled them off and left them in a crusty heap on our porch i didnt exactly give her a tour i locked myself in the bathroom instead and after about ten minutes of yelling back at her that no i wasnt coming out anytime soon things got quiet out in the hall another ten minutes went by before i got the nerve to peek out the door no juli i snuck out and looked around and yes she was gone not a very sophisticated ditch but hey i was only seven my troubles were far from over though every day she came back over and over again can bryce play i could hear her asking from my hiding place behind the couch is he ready yet one time she even cut across the yard and looked through my window i spotted her in the nick of time and dove under my bed but man that right there tells you something about juli baker shes got no concept of personal space no respect for privacy the world is her playground and watch out below julis on the slide lucky for me my dad was willing to run block and he did it over and over again he told her i was busy or sleeping or just plain gone he was a lifesaver my sister on the other hand tried to sabotage me any chance she got lynettas like that shes four years older than me and buddy ive learned from watching her how not to run your life shes got antagonize written all over her just look at her not crosseyed or with your tongue sticking out or anything just look at her and youve started an argument i used to knockdowndragout with her but its just not worth it girls dont fight fair they pull your hair and gouge you and pinch you then they run off gasping to mommy when you try and defend yourself with a fist then you get locked into timeout and for what no my friend the secret is dont snap at the bait let it dangle swim around it laugh it off after a while theyll give up and try to lure someone else at least thats the way it is with lynetta and the bonus of having her as a painintherear sister was figuring out that this method works on everyone teachers jerks at school even mom and dad seriously theres no winning arguments with your parents so why get all pumped up over them it is way better to dive down and get out of the way than it is to get clobbered by some parental tidal wave the funny thing is lynettas still clueless when it comes to dealing with mom and dad she goes straight into thrash mode and is too busy drowning in the argument to take a deep breath and dive for calmer water and she thinks im stupid anyway true to form lynetta tried to bait me with juli those first few days she even snuck her past dad once and marched her all around the house hunting me down i wedged myself up on the top shelf of my closet and lucky for me neither of them looked up a few minutes later i heard dad yell at juli to get off the antique furniture and once again she got booted i dont think i went outside that whole first week i helped unpack stuff and watched tv and just kind of hung around while my mom and dad arranged and rearranged the furniture debating whether empire settees and french rococo tables should even be put in the same room so believe me i was dying to go outside but every time i checked through the window i could see juli showing off in her yard shed be heading a soccer ball or doing high kicks with it or dribbling it up and down their driveway and when she wasnt busy showing off shed just sit on the curb with the ball between her feet staring at our house my mom didnt understand why it was so awful that that cute little girl had held my hand she thought i should make friends with her i thought you liked soccer honey why dont you go out there and kick the ball around because i didnt want to be kicked around thats why and although i couldnt say it like that at the time i still had enough sense at age seven and a half to know that juli baker was dangerous unavoidably dangerous as it turns out the minute i walked into mrs yelsons secondgrade classroom i was dead meat bryce juli squeals youre here then she charges across the room and tackles me mrs yelson tried to explain this attack away as a welcome hug but man that was no hug that was a frontline takeemdown tackle and even though i shook her off it was too late i was branded for life everyone jeered wheres your girl friend bryce are you married yet bryce and then when she chased me around at recess and tried to lay kisses on me the whole school started singing bryce and juli sitting in a tree kissi ng my first year in town was a disaster third grade wasnt much better she was still hot on my trail every time i turned around same with fourth but then in fifth grade i took action it started out slow one of those nahthatsnotright ideas you get and forget but the more i played with the idea the more i thought what better way to ward juli off what better way to say to her juli you are not my type and so my friend i hatched the plan i asked shelly stalls out to fully appreciate the brilliance of this you have to understand

that juli hates shelly stalls she always has though it beats me why shellys nice and shes friendly and shes got a lot of hair whats not to like but juli hated her and i was going to make this little gem of knowledge the solution to my problem what i was thinking was that shelly would eat lunch at our table and maybe walk around a little with me that way anytime juli was around all id have to do was hang a little closer to shelly and things would just naturally take care of themselves what happened though is that shelly took things way too seriously she went around telling everybody including juli that we were in love in no time juli and shelly got into some kind of catfight and while shelly was recovering from that my supposed friend garrett who had been totally behind this plan told her what i was up to hes always denied it but ive since learned that his code of honor is easily corrupted by weepy females that afternoon the principal tried crossexamining me but i wouldnt cop to anything i just kept telling her that i was sorry and that i really didnt understand what had happened finally she let me go shelly cried for days and followed me around school sniffling and making me feel like a real jerk which was even worse than having juli as a shadow everything blew over at the oneweek mark though when shelly officially dumped me and started going out with kyle larsen then juli started up with the googoo eyes again and i was back to square one now in sixth grade things changed though whether they improved is hard to say i dont remember juli actually chasing me in the sixth grade but i do remember her sniffing me yes my friend i said sniffing and you can blame that on our teacher mr mertins he stuck juli to me like glue mr mertins has got some kind of doctorate in seating arrangements or something because he analyzed and scrutinized and practically baptized the seats we had to sit in and of course he decided to seat juli right next to me juli baker is the kind of annoying person who makes a point of letting you know shes smart her hand is the first one up her answers are usually complete dissertations her projects are always turned in early and used as weapons against the rest of the class teachers always have to hold her project up and say this is what im looking for class this is an example of aplus work add all the extra credit she does to an already perfect score and i swear shes never gotten less than percent in any subject but after mr mertins stuck juli right next to me her annoying knowledge of all subjects far and wide came in handy see suddenly julis perfect answers written in perfect cursive were right across the aisle just an eyeshot away you wouldnt believe the number of answers i snagged from her i started getting as and bs on everything it was great but then mr mertins pulled the shift he had some new idea for optimizing positional latitude and longitude and when the dust finally settled i was sitting right in front of juli baker this is where the sniffing comes in that maniac started leaning forward and sniffing my hair shed edge her nose practically up to my scalp and sniffsniffsniff i tried elbowing and backkicking i tried scooting my chair way forward or putting my backpack between me and the seat nothing helped shed just scoot up too or lean over a little farther and sniffsniffsniff i finally asked mr mertins to move me but he wouldnt do it something about not wanting to disturb the delicate balance of educational energies whatever i was stuck with her sniffing and since i couldnt see her perfectly penned answers anymore my grades took a dive especially in spelling then one time during a test julis in the middle of sniffing my hair when she notices that ive blown a spelling word a lot of words suddenly the sniffing stops and the whispering starts at first i couldnt believe it juli baker cheating but sure enough she was spelling words for me right in my ear julid always been sly about sniffing which really bugged me because no one ever noticed her doing it but she was just as sly about giving me answers which was okay by me the bad thing about it was that i started counting on her spelling in my ear i mean why study when you dont have to right but after a while taking all those answers made me feel sort of indebted to her how can you tell someone to bug off or quit sniffing you when you owe them its you know wrong so i spent the sixth grade somewhere between uncomfortable and unhappy but i kept thinking that next year next year things would be different wed be in junior high a big school in different classes it would be a world with too many people to worry about ever seeing juli baker again it was finally finally going to be over flipped the first day i met bryce loski i flipped honestly one look at him and i became a lunatic its his eyes something in his eyes theyre blue and framed in the blackness of his lashes theyre dazzling absolutely breathtaking its been over six years now and i learned long ago to hide my feelings but oh those first days those first years i thought i would die for wanting to be with him two days before the second grade is when it started although the anticipation began weeks beforeever since my mother had told me that there was a family with a boy my age moving into the new house right
Document 4
across the street soccer camp had ended and id been so bored because there was nobody absolutely nobody in the neighborhood to play with oh there were kids but every one of them was older that was dandy for my brothers but what it left me was home alone my mother was there but she had better things to do than kick a soccer ball around so she said anyway at the time i didnt think there was anything better than kicking a soccer ball around especially not the likes of laundry or dishes or vacuuming but my mother didnt agree and the danger of being home alone with her was that shed recruit me to help her wash or dust or vacuum and she wouldnt tolerate the dribbling of a soccer ball around the house as i moved from chore to chore to play it safe i waited outside for weeks just in case the new neighbors moved in early literally it was weeks i entertained myself by playing soccer with our dog champ mostly hed just block because a dog cant exactly kick and score but once in a while hed dribble with his nose the scent of a ball must overwhelm a dog though because champ would eventually try to chomp it then lose the ball to me when the loskis moving van finally arrived everyone in my family was happy little julianna was finally going to have a playmate my mother being the truly sensible adult that she is made me wait more than an hour before going over to meet him give them a chance to stretch their legs julianna she said theyll want some time to adjust she wouldnt even let me watch from the yard i know you sweetheart somehow that ball will wind up in their yard and youll just have to go retrieve it so i watched from the window and every few minutes id ask now and shed say give them a little while longer would you then the phone rang and the minute i was sure she was good and preoccupied i tugged on her sleeve and asked now she nodded and whispered okay but take it easy ill be over there in a minute i was too excited not to charge across the street but i did try very hard to be civilized once i got to the moving van i stood outside looking in for a recordbreaking length of time which was hard because there he was about halfway back my new suretobe best friend bryce loski bryce wasnt really doing much of anything he was more hanging back watching his father move boxes onto the liftgate i remember feeling sorry for mr loski because he looked worn out moving boxes all by himself i also remember that he and bryce were wearing matching turquoise polo shirts which i thought was really cute really nice when i couldnt stand it any longer i called hi into the van which made bryce jump and then quick as a cricket he started pushing a box like hed been working all along i could tell from the way bryce was acting so guilty that he was supposed to be moving boxes but he was sick of it hed probably been moving things for days it was easy to see that he needed a rest he needed some juice something it was also easy to see that mr loski wasnt about to let him quit he was going to keep on moving boxes around until he collapsed and by then bryce might be dead dead before hed had the chance to move in the tragedy of it catapulted me into the moving van i had to help i had to save him when i got to his side to help him shove a box forward the poor boy was so exhausted that he just moved aside and let me take over mr loski didnt want me to help but at least i saved bryce id been in the moving van all of three minutes when his dad sent him off to help his mother unpack things inside the house i chased bryce up the walkway and thats when everything changed you see i caught up to him and grabbed his arm trying to stop him so maybe we could play a little before he got trapped inside and the next thing i know hes holding my hand looking right into my eyes my heart stopped it just stopped beating and for the first time in my life i had that feeling you know like the world is moving all around you all beneath you all inside you and youre floating floating in midair and the only thing keeping you from drifting away is the other persons eyes theyre connected to yours by some invisible physical force and they hold you fast while the rest of the world swirls and twirls and falls completely away i almost got my first kiss that day im sure of it but then his mother came out the front door and he was so embarrassed that his cheeks turned completely red and the next thing you know hes hiding in the bathroom i was waiting for him to come out when his sister lynetta saw me in the hallway she seemed big and mature to me and since she wanted to know what was going on i told her a little bit about it i shouldnt have though because she wiggled the bathroom doorknob and started teasing bryce something fierce hey baby brother she called through the door theres a hot chick out here waiting for you whatsa matter afraid shes got cooties it was so embarrassing i yanked on her arm and told her to stop it but she wouldnt so finally i just left i found my mother outside talking to mrs loski mom had given her the beautiful lemon bundt cake that was
Document 5
supposed to be our dessert that night the powdered sugar looked soft and white and the cake was still warm sending sweet lemon smells into the air my mouth was watering just looking at it but it was in mrs loskis hands and i knew there was no getting it back all i could do was try to eat up the smells while i listened to the two of them discuss grocery stores and the weather forecast after that mom and i went home it was very strange i hadnt gotten to play with bryce at all all i knew was that his eyes were a dizzying blue that he had a sister who was not to be trusted and that hed almost kissed me i fell asleep that night thinking about the kiss that might have been what did a kiss feel like anyway somehow i knew it wouldnt be like the one i got from mom or dad at bedtime the same species maybe but a radically different beast to be sure like a wolf and a whippetonly science would put them on the same tree looking back on the second grade i like to think it was at least partly scientific curiosity that made me chase after that kiss but to be honest it was probably more those blue eyes all through the second and third grades i couldnt seem to stop myself from following him from sitting by him from just wanting to be near him by the fourth grade id learned to control myself the sight of himthe thought of himstill sent my heart humming but my legs didnt actually chase after him anymore i just watched and thought and dreamed then in the fifth grade shelly stalls came into the picture shelly stalls is a ninny a whiny gossipy backstabbing ninny who says one thing to one person and the opposite to another now that were in junior high shes the undisputed diva of drama but even back in elementary school she knew how to put on a performance especially when it came to pe i never once saw her run laps or do calisthenics instead she would go into her delicate act claiming her body would absolutely collapse from the strain if she ran or jumped or stretched it worked every year shed bring in some note and be sure to swoon a little for the teacher the first few days of the year after which shed be excused from anything that required muscles she never even put up her own chair at the end of the day the only muscles she exercised regularly were the ones around her mouth and those she worked out nonstop if there was an olympic contest for talking shelly stalls would sweep the event well shed at least win the gold and silver one medal for each side of her mouth what bugged me about it was not the fact that she got out of pewhod want her on their team anyway what bugged me about it was that anyone who bothered to look would know that it wasnt asthma or weak ankles or her being delicate that was stopping her it was her hair she had mountains of it twisted this way or that clipped or beaded braided or swirled her ponytails rivaled the ones on carousel horses and on the days she let it all hang down shed sort of shimmy and cuddle inside it like it was a blanket so that practically all you saw of her face was her nose good luck playing foursquare with a blanket over your head my solution to shelly stalls was to ignore her which worked just dandy until about halfway through the fifth grade when i saw her holding hands with bryce my bryce the one who was still embarrassed over holding my hand two days before the second grade the one who was still too shy to say much more than hello to me the one who was still walking around with my first kiss how could shelly have wormed her hand into his that pushy little princess had no business hanging on to him like that bryce looked over his shoulder from time to time as they walked along and he was looking at me my first thought was that he was telling me he was sorry then it dawned on me he needed my help absolutely thats what it had to be shelly stalls was too delicate to shake off too swirly to be pushed away shed unravel and start sniffling and oh how embarrassing that would be for him no this wasnt a job a boy could do gracefully this was a job for a girl i didnt even bother checking around for other candidatesi had her off of him in two seconds flat bryce ran away the minute he was free but not shelly oh nonono she came at me scratching and pulling and twisting anything she could get her hands on telling me that bryce was hers and there was no way she was letting him go how delicate i was hoping for herds of teachers to appear so they could see the real shelly stalls in action but it was too late by the time anyone arrived on the scene i had fluffy in a headlock and her arm twisted back in a hammerlock and no amount of her squawking or scratching was going to get me to un lock her until a teacher arrived in the end shelly went home early with a bad case of mussedup hair while i told my side of things to the principal mrs shultz is a sturdy lady who probably secretly appreciates the value of a swift kick well placed and although she told me that it would be better if i let other people work out their own dilemmas she definitely understood about shelly stalls and her hair and told me she

was glad id had the selfcontrol to do nothing more than restrain her shelly was back the next day with a head full of braids and of course she got everybody whispering about me but i just ignored them the facts spoke for themselves bryce didnt go anywhere near her for the rest of the year thats not to say that bryce held my hand after that but he did start being a little friendlier to me especially in the sixth grade after mr mertins sat us right next to each other in the third row back sitting next to bryce was nice he was nice hed say hi juli to me every morning and once in a while id catch him looking my way hed always blush and go back to his own work and i couldnt help but smile he was so shy and so cute we talked to each other more too especially after mr mertins moved me behind him mr mertins had a detention policy about spelling where if you missed more than seven out of twentyfive words you had to spend lunch inside with him writing your words over and over and over again the pressure of detention made bryce panic and even though it bothered my conscience id lean in and whisper answers to him hoping that maybe i could spend lunch with him instead his hair smelled like watermelon and his ear lobes had fuzz soft blond fuzz and i wondered about that how does a boy with such black hair wind up with blond ear fuzz whats it doing there anyway i checked my own earlobes in the mirror but couldnt find much of anything on them and i didnt spot any on other peoples either i thought about asking mr mertins about earlobe fuzz when we were discussing evolution in science but i didnt instead i spent the year whispering spelling words sniffing watermelon and wondering if i was ever going to get my kiss buddy beware seventh grade brought changes all right but the biggest one didnt happen at school it happened at home granddad duncan came to live with us at first it was kind of weird because none of us really knew him except for mom of course and even though shes spent the past year and a half trying to convince us hes a great guy from what i can tell the thing he likes to do best is stare out the frontroom window theres not much to see out there except the bakers front yard but you can find him there day or night sitting in the big easy chair they moved in with him staring out the window okay so he also reads tom clancy novels and the newspapers and does crossword puzzles and tracks his stocks but those things are all distractions given no one to justify it to the man would stare out the window until he fell asleep not that theres anything wrong with that it just seems so boring mom says he stares like that because he misses grandma but thats not something granddad had ever discussed with me as a matter of fact he never discussed much of anything with me until a few months ago when he read about juli in the newspaper now juli baker did not wind up on the front page of the mayfield times for being an eighth grade einstein like you might suspect no my friend she got frontpage coverage because she refused to climb out of a sycamore tree not that i could tell a sycamore from a maple or a birch for that matter but juli of course knew what kind of tree it was and passed that knowledge along to every creature in her wake so this tree this sycamore tree was up the hill on a vacant lot on collier street and it was massive massive and ugly it was twisted and gnarled and bent and i kept expecting the thing to blow over in the wind one day last year id finally had enough of her yakking about that stupid tree i came right out and told her that it was not a magnificent sycamore it was in reality the ugliest tree known to man and you know what she said she said i was visually challenged visually challenged this from the girl who lives in a house thats the scourge of the neighborhood theyve got bushes growing over windows weeds sticking out all over the place and a barnyards worth of animals running wild im talking dogs cats chickens even snakes i swear to god her brothers have a boa constrictor in their room they dragged me in there when i was about ten and made me watch it eat a rat a live beadyeyed rat they held that rodent up by its tail and gulp the boa swallowed it whole that snake gave me nightmares for a month anyway normally i wouldnt care about someones yard but the bakers mess bugged my dad bigtime and he channeled his frustration into our yard he said it was our neighborly duty to show them what a yards supposed to look like so while mike and matt are busy plumping up their boa im having to mow and edge our yard then sweep the walkways and gutter which is going a little overboard if you ask me and youd think julis dadwhos a big strong bricklaying dude would fix the place up but no according to my mom he spends all his free time painting his landscapes dont seem like anything special to me but judging by his price tags he thinks quite a lot of them we see them every year at the mayfield county fair and my parents always say the same thing the world would have more beauty in it if hed fix up the yard instead mom and julis mom do talk some i think my

mom feels sorry for mrs baker she says she married a dreamer and because of that one of the two of them will always be unhappy whatever maybe julis aesthetic sensibilities have been permanently screwed up by her father and none of this is her fault but juli has always thought that that sycamore tree was gods gift to our little corner of the universe back in the third and fourth grades she used to clown around with her brothers in the branches or peel big chunks of bark off so they could slide down the crook in its trunk it seemed like they were playing in it whenever my mom took us somewhere in the car julid be swinging from the branches ready to fall and break every bone in her body while we were waiting at the stoplight and my mom would shake her head and say dont you ever climb that tree like that do you hear me bryce i never want to see you doing that you either lynetta that is much too dangerous my sister would roll her eyes and say as if while id slump beneath the window and pray for the light to change before juli squealed my name for the world to hear i did try to climb it once in the fifth grade it was the day after juli had rescued my kite from its mutant toyeating foliage she climbed miles up to get my kite and when she came down she was actually very cool about it she didnt hold my kite hostage and stick her lips out like i was afraid she might she just handed it over and then backed away i was relieved but i also felt like a weenie when id seen where my kite was trapped i was sure it was a goner not juli she scrambled up and got it down in no time man it was embarrassing so i made a mental picture of how high shed climbed and the next day i set off to outdo her by at least two branches i made it past the crook up a few limbs and then just to see how i was doing i looked down mistake it felt like i was on top of the empire state building without a bungee i tried looking up to where my kite had been but it was hopeless i was indeed a treeclimbing weenie then junior high started and my dream of a julifree existence shattered i had to take the bus and youknowwho did too there were about eight kids altogether at our bus stop which created a buffer zone but it was no comfort zone juli always tried to stand beside me or talk to me or in some other way mortify me and then she started climbing the girl is in the seventh grade and shes climbing a tree way way up in a tree and why does she do it so she can yell down at us that the bus is five four three blocks away blowbyblow traffic watch from a tree what every kid in junior high feels like hearing first thing in the morning she tried to get me to come up there with her too bryce come on you wont believe the colors its absolutely magnificent bryce youve got to come up here yeah i could just hear it bryce and juli sitting in a tree was i ever going to leave the second grade behind one morning i was specifically not looking up when out of nowhere she swings down from a branch and practically knocks me over heart attack i dropped my backpack and wrenched my neck and that did it i refused to wait under that tree with that maniac monkey on the loose anymore i started leaving the house at the very last minute i made up my own waiting spot and when id see the bus pull up id truck up the hill and get on board no juli no problem and that my friend took care of the rest of seventh grade and almost all of eighth too until one day a few months ago thats when i heard a commotion up the hill and could see some big trucks parked up on collier street where the bus pulls in there were some men shouting stuff up at juli who was of course five stories up in the tree all the other kids started to gather under the tree too and i could hear them telling her she had to come down she was fine that was obvious to anyone with a pair of ears but i couldnt figure out what they were all arguing about i trucked up the hill and as i got closer and saw what the men were holding i figured out in a hurry what was making juli refuse to come out of the tree chain saws dont get me wrong here okay the tree was an ugly mutant tangle of gnarly branches the girl arguing with those men was juli the worlds peskiest bossiest most knowitall female but all of a sudden my stomach completely bailed on me juli loved that tree stupid as it was she loved that tree and cutting it down would be like cutting out her heart everyone tried to talk her down even me but she said she wasnt coming down not ever and then she tried to talk us up bryce please come up here with me they wont cut it down if were all up here for a second i considered it but then the bus arrived and i talked myself out of it it wasnt my tree and even though she acted like it was it wasnt julis either we boarded the bus and left her behind but school was pretty much a waste i couldnt seem to stop thinking about juli was she still up in the tree

were they going to arrest her when the bus dropped us off that afternoon juli was gone and so was half the tree the top branches the place my kite had been stuck her favorite perch they were all gone we watched them work for a little while the chain saws gunning at full throttle smoking as they chewed through wood the tree looked lopsided and naked and after a few minutes i had to get out of there it was like watching someone dismember a body and for the first time in ages i felt like crying crying over a stupid tree that i hated i went home and tried to shake it off but i kept wondering should i have gone up the tree with her would it have done any good i thought about calling juli to tell her i was sorry theyd cut it down but i didnt it wouldve been too i dont know weird she didnt show at the bus stop the next morning and didnt ride the bus home that afternoon either then that night right before dinner my grandfather summoned me into the front room he didnt call to me as i was walking by that would have bordered on friendliness what he did was talk to my mother who talked to me i dont know what its about honey she said maybe hes just ready to get to know you a little better great the mans had a year and a half to get acquainted and he chooses now to get to know me but i couldnt exactly blow him off my grandfathers a big man with a meaty nose and greasedback saltandpepper hair he lives in house slippers and a sports coat and ive never seen a whisker on him they grow but he shaves them off like three times a day its a real recreational activity for him besides his meaty nose hes also got big meaty hands i suppose youd notice his hands regardless but what makes you realize just how beefy they are is his wedding ring that things never going to come off and even though my mother says thats how it should be i think he ought to get it cut off another few pounds and that rings going to amputate his finger when i went in to see him those big hands of his were woven together resting on the newspaper in his lap i said granddad you wanted to see me have a seat son son half the time he didnt seem to know who i was and now suddenly i was son i sat in the chair opposite him and waited tell me about your friend juli baker juli shes not exactly my friend why is that he asked calmly like he had prior knowledge i started to justify it then stopped myself and asked why do you want to know he opened the paper and pressed down the crease and thats when i realized that juli baker had made the front page of the mayfield times there was a huge picture of her in the tree surrounded by a fire brigade and policemen and then some smaller photos i couldnt make out very well can i see that he folded it up but didnt hand it over why isnt she your friend bryce because shes i shook my head and said youd have to know juli id like to what why because the girls got an iron backbone why dont you invite her over sometime an iron backbone granddad you dont understand that girl is a royal pain shes a show off shes a knowitall and she is pushy beyond belief is that so yes thats absolutely so and shes been stalking me since the second grade he frowned then looked out the window and asked theyve lived there that long i think they were all born there he frowned some more before he looked back at me and said a girl like that doesnt live next door to everyone you know lucky them he studied me long and hard i said what but he didnt flinch he just kept staring at me and i couldnt take it i had to look away keep in mind that this was the first real conversation id had with my grandfather this was the first time hed made the effort to talk to me about something besides passing the salt and does he want to get to know me no he wants to know about juli i couldnt just stand up and leave even though thats what i felt like doing somehow i knew if i left like that hed quit talking to me at all even about salt so i sat there feeling sort of tortured was he mad at me how could he be mad at me i hadnt done anything wrong when i looked up he was sitting there holding out the newspaper to me read this he said without prejudice i took it and when he went back to looking out the window i knew id been dismissed by the time i got down to my room i was mad i slammed my bedroom door and flopped down on the bed and after fuming about my sorry excuse for a grandfather for a while i shoved the newspaper in the bottom drawer of my desk like i needed to know any more about juli baker at dinner my mother asked me why i was so sulky and she kept looking from me to my grandfather granddad didnt seem to need any salt which was a good thing because i might have thrown the shaker at him my sister and dad were all business as usual though lynetta ate about two raisins out of her carrot salad then peeled the skin and meat off her chicken wing and nibbled gristle off the bone while my father filled up airspace talking about

office politics and the need for a shakedown in upper management no one was listening to him no one ever does when he gets on one of his ifiranthe circus jags but for once mom wasnt even pretending and for once she wasnt trying to convince lynetta that dinner was delicious either she just kept eyeing me and granddad trying to pick up on why we were miffed at each other not that he had anything to be miffed at me about what had i done to him anyway nothing nada but he was i could tell and i completely avoided looking at him until about halfway through dinner when i sneaked a peek he was studying me all right and even though it wasnt a mean stare or a hard stare it was you know firm steady and it weirded me out what was his deal i didnt look at him again or at my mother i just went back to eating and pretended to listen to my dad and the first chance i got i excused myself and holed up in my room i was planning to call my friend garrett like i usually do when im bent about something i even punched in his number but i dont know i just hung upand later when my mom came in i faked like i was sleeping i havent done that in years the whole night was weird like that i just wanted to be left alone juli wasnt at the bus stop the next morning or friday morning she was at school but youd never know it if you didnt actually look she didnt whip her hand through the air trying to get the teacher to call on her or charge through the halls getting to class she didnt make unsolicited comments for the teachers edification or challenge the kids who took cuts in the milk line she just sat quiet i told myself i should be glad about it it was like she wasnt even there and isnt that what id always wanted but still i felt bad about her tree about how she hurried off to eat by herself in the library at lunch about how her eyes were red around the edges i wanted to tell her man im sorry about your sycamore tree but the words never seemed to come out by the middle of the next week theyd finished taking down the tree they cleared the lot and even tried to pull up the stump but that sucker would not budge so they wound up grinding it down into the dirt juli still didnt show at the bus stop and by the end of the week i learned from garrett that she was riding a bike he said hed seen her on the side of the road twice that week putting the chain back on the derailleur of a rusty old ten speed i figured shed be back it was a long ride out to mayfield junior high and once she got over the tree shed start riding the bus again i even caught myself looking for her not on the lookout just looking then one day it rained and i thought for sure shed be up at the bus stop but no garrett said he saw her trucking along on her bike in a bright yellow poncho and in math i noticed that her pants were still soaked from the knees down when math let out i started to chase after her to tell her that she ought to try riding the bus again but i stopped myself in the nick of time what was i thinking that juli wouldnt take a little friendly concern and completely misinterpret it whoa now buddy beware better to just leave well enough alone after all the last thing i needed was for juli baker to think i missed her the sycamore tree i love to watch my father paint or really i love to hear him talk while he paints the words always come out soft and somehow heavy when hes brushing on the layers of a landscape not sad weary maybe but peaceful my father doesnt have a studio or anything and since the garage is stuffed with things that everyone thinks they need but no one ever uses he paints outside outside is where the best landscapes are only theyre nowhere near our house so what he does is keep a camera in his truck his job as a mason takes him to lots of different locations and hes always on the lookout for a great sunrise or sunset or even just a nice field with sheep or cows then he picks out one of the snapshots clips it to his easel and paints the paintings come out fine but ive always felt a little sorry for him having to paint beautiful scenes in our backyard which is not exactly picturesque it never was much of a yard but after i started raising chickens things didnt exactly improve dad doesnt seem to see the backyard or the chickens when hes painting though its not just the snapshot or the canvas he sees either its something much bigger he gets this look in his eye like hes transcended the yard the neighborhood the world and as his big callused hands sweep a tiny brush against the canvas its almost like his body has been possessed by some graceful spiritual being when i was little my dad would let me sit beside him on the porch while he painted as long as id be quiet i dont do quiet easily but i discovered that after five or ten minutes without a peep hed start talking ive learned a lot about my dad that way he told me all sorts of stories about what hed done when he was my age and other things toolike how he got his first job delivering hay and how he

wished hed finished college when i got a little older he still talked about himself and his childhood but he also started asking questions about me what were we learning at school what book was i currently reading what did i think about this or that then one time he surprised me and asked me about bryce why was i so crazy about bryce i told him about his eyes and his hair and the way his cheeks blush but i dont think i explained it very well because when i was done dad shook his head and told me in soft heavy words that i needed to start looking at the whole landscape i didnt really know what he meant by that but it made me want to argue with him how could he possibly understand about bryce he didnt know him but this was not an arguing spot those were scattered throughout the house but not out here we were both quiet for a recordbreaking amount of time before he kissed me on the forehead and said proper lighting is everything julianna proper lighting what was that supposed to mean i sat there wondering but i was afraid that by asking id be admitting that i wasnt mature enough to understand and for some reason it felt obvious like i should understand after that he didnt talk so much about events as he did about ideas and the older i got the more philosophical he seemed to get i dont know if he really got more philosophical or if he just thought i could handle it now that i was in the double digits mostly the things he talked about floated around me but once in a while something would happen and i would understand exactly what he had meant a painting is more than the sum of its parts he would tell me and then go on to explain how the cow by itself is just a cow and the meadow by itself is just grass and flowers and the sun peeking through the trees is just a beam of light but put them all together and youve got magic i understood what he was saying but i never felt what he was saying until one day when i was up in the sycamore tree the sycamore tree had been at the top of the hill forever it was on a big vacant lot giving shade in the summer and a place for birds to nest in the spring it had a builtin slide for us too its trunk bent up and around in almost a complete spiral and it was so much fun to ride down my mom told me she thought the tree must have been damaged as a sapling but survived and now maybe a hundred years later it was still there the biggest tree shed ever seen a testimony to endurance is what she called it i had always played in the tree but i didnt become a serious climber until the fifth grade when i went up to rescue a kite that was stuck in its branches id first spotted the kite floating free through the air and then saw it divebomb somewhere up the hill by the sycamore tree ive flown kites before and i knowsometimes theyre gone forever and sometimes theyre just waiting in the middle of the road for you to rescue them kites can be lucky or they can be ornery ive had both kinds and a lucky kite is definitely worth chasing after this kite looked lucky to me it wasnt anything fancy just an oldfashioned diamond with blue and yellow stripes but it stuttered along in a friendly way and when it divebombed it seemed to do so from exhaustion as opposed to spite ornery kites divebomb out of spite they never get exhausted because they wont stay up long enough to poop out thirty feet up they just sort of smirk at you and crash for the fun of it so champ and i ran up to collier street and after scouting out the road champ started barking at the sycamore tree i looked up and spotted it too flashing blue and yellow through the branches it was a long ways up but i thought id give it a shot i shinnied up the trunk took a shortcut across the slide and started climbing champ kept a good eye on me barking me along and soon i was higher than id ever been but still the kite seemed forever away then below me i noticed bryce coming around the corner and through the vacant lot and i could tell from the way he was looking up that this was his kite what a lucky lucky kite this was turning out to be can you climb that high he called up to me sure i called back and up up up i went the branches were strong with just the right amount of intersections to make climbing easy and the higher i got the more amazed i was by the view id never seen a view like that it was like being in an airplane above all the rooftops above the other trees above the world then i looked down down at bryce and suddenly i got dizzy and weak in the knees i was miles off the ground bryce shouted can you reach it i caught my breath and managed to call down no problem then forced myself to concentrate on those blue and yellow stripes to focus on them and only them as i shinnied up up up finally i touched it i grasped it i had the kite in my hand but the string was tangled in the branches above and i couldnt seem to pull it free bryce called break the string and somehow i managed to do just that when i had the kite free i needed a minute to rest

to recover before starting down so instead of looking at the ground below me i held on tight and looked out out across the rooftops thats when the fear of being up so high began to lift and in its place came the most amazing feeling that i was flying just soaring above the earth sailing among the clouds then i began to notice how wonderful the breeze smelled it smelled like sunshine like sunshine and wild grass and pomegranates and rain i couldnt stop breathing it in filling my lungs again and again with the sweetest smell id ever known bryce called up are you stuck which brought me down to earth carefully i backed up prized stripes in hand and as i worked my way down i could see bryce circling the tree watching me to make sure i was okay by the time i hit the slide the heady feeling id had in the tree was changing into the heady realization that bryce and i were alone alone my heart was positively racing as i held the kite out to him but before he could take it champ nudged me from behind and i could feel his cold wet nose against my skin against my skin i grabbed my jeans in back and thats when i realized the seat of my pants was ripped wide open bryce laughed a little nervous laugh so i could tell he knew and for once mine were the cheeks that were beet red he took his kite and ran off leaving me to inspect the damage i did eventually get over the embarrassment of my jeans but i never got over the view i kept thinking of what it felt like to be up so high in that tree i wanted to see it to feel it again and again it wasnt long before i wasnt afraid of being up so high and found the spot that became my spot i could sit there for hours just looking out at the world sunsets were amazing some days theyd be purple and pink some days theyd be a blazing orange setting fire to clouds across the horizon it was on a day like that when my fathers notion of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts moved from my head to my heart the view from my sycamore was more than rooftops and clouds and wind and colors combined it was magic and i started marveling at how i was feeling both humble and majestic how was that possible how could i be so full of peace and full of wonder how could this simple tree make me feel so complex so alive i went up the tree every chance i got and in junior high that became almost every day because the bus to our school picks up on collier street right in front of the sycamore tree at first i just wanted to see how high i could get before the bus pulled up but before long i was leaving the house early so i could get clear up to my spot to see the sun rise or the birds flutter about or just the other kids converge on the curb i tried to convince the kids at the bus stop to climb up with me even a little ways but all of them said they didnt want to get dirty turn down a chance to feel magic for fear of a little dirt i couldnt believe it id never told my mother about climbing the tree being the truly sensible adult that she is she would have told me it was too dangerous my brothers being brothers wouldnt have cared that left my father the one person i knew would understand still i was afraid to tell him hed tell my mother and pretty soon theyd insist that i stop so i kept quiet kept climbing and felt a somewhat lonely joy as i looked out over the world then a few months ago i found myself talking to the tree an entire conversation just me and a tree and on the climb down i felt like crying why didnt i have someone real to talk to why didnt i have a best friend like everyone else seemed to sure there were kids i knew at school but none of them were close friends theyd have no interest in climbing the tree in smelling the sunshine that night after dinner my father went outside to paint in the cold of the night under the glare of the porch light he went out to put the finishing touches on a sunrise hed been working on i got my jacket and went out to sit beside him quiet as a mouse after a few minutes he said whats on your mind sweetheart in all the times id sat out there with him hed never asked me that i looked at him but couldnt seem to speak he mixed two hues of orange together and very softly he said talk to me i sighed so heavily it surprised even me i understand why you come out here dad he tried kidding me would you mind explaining it to your mother really dad i understand now about the whole being greater than the sum of the parts he stopped mixing you do what happened tell me about it so i told him about the sycamore tree about the view and the sounds and the colors and the wind and how being up so high felt like flying felt like magic he didnt interrupt me once and when my confession was through i looked at him and whispered would you climb up there with me he thought about this a long time then smiled and said im not much of a climber anymore julianna but ill give it a shot sure how about this weekend when weve got lots of daylight

to work with great i went to bed so excited that i dont think i slept more than five minutes the whole night saturday was right around the corner i couldnt wait the next morning i raced to the bus stop extra early and climbed the tree i caught the sun rising through the clouds sending streaks of fire from one end of the world to the other and i was in the middle of making a mental list of all the things i was going to show my father when i heard a noise below i looked down and parked right beneath me were two trucks big trucks one of them was towing a long empty trailer and the other had a cherry picker on itthe kind they use to work on overhead power lines and telephone poles there were four men standing around talking drinking from thermoses and i almost called down to them im sorry but you cant park there thats a bus stop but before i could one of the men reached into the back of a truck and started unloading tools gloves ropes a chain earmuffs and then chain saws three chain saws and still i didnt get it i kept looking around for what it was they could possibly be there to cut down then one of the kids who rides the bus showed up and started talking to them and pretty soon he was pointing up at me one of the men called hey you better come down from there we gotta take this thing down i held on to the branch tight because suddenly it felt as though i might fall i managed to choke out the tree yeah now come on down but who told you to cut it down the owner he called back but why even from forty feet up i could see him scowl because hes gonna build himself a house and he cant very well do that with this tree in the way now come on girl weve got work to do by that time most of the kids had gathered for the bus they werent saying anything to me just looking up at me and turning from time to time to talk to each other then bryce appeared so i knew the bus was about to arrive i searched across the rooftops and sure enough there it was less than four blocks away my heart was crazy with panic i didnt know what to do i couldnt leave and let them cut down the tree i cried you cant cut it down you just cant one of the men shook his head and said i am this close to calling the police you are trespassing and obstructing progress on a contracted job now are you going to come down or are we going to cut you down the bus was three blocks away id never missed school for any reason other than legitimate illness but i knew in my heart that i was going to miss my ride youre going to have to cut me down i yelled then i had an idea theyd never cut it down if all of us were in the tree theyd have to listen hey guys i called to my classmates get up here with me they cant cut it down if were all up here marcia tony bryce cmon you guys dont let them do this they just stood there staring up at me i could see the bus one block away come on you guys you dont have to come up this high just a little ways please the bus blasted up and pulled to the curb in front of the trucks and when the doors folded open one by one my classmates climbed on board what happened after that is a bit of a blur i remember the neighbors gathering and the police with megaphones i remember the fire brigade and some guy saying it was his blasted tree and id darn well better get out of it somebody tracked down my mother who cried and pleaded and acted not at all the way a sensible mother should but i was not coming down i was not coming down then my father came racing up he jumped out of his pickup truck and after talking with my mother for a few minutes he got the guy in the cherry picker to give him a lift up to where i was after that it was all over i started crying and tried to get him to look out over the rooftops but he wouldnt he said that no view was worth his little girls safety he got me down and he took me home only i couldnt stay there i couldnt stand the sound of chain saws in the distance so dad took me with him to work and while he put up a block wall i sat in his truck and cried i mustve cried for two weeks straight oh sure i went to school and i functioned the best i could but i didnt go there on the bus i started riding my bike instead taking the long way so i wouldnt have to go up to collier street up to a pile of sawdust that used to be the earths most magnificent sycamore tree then one evening when i was locked up in my room my father came in with something under a towel i could tell it was a painting because thats how he transports the important ones when he shows them in the park he sat down resting the painting on the floor in front of him i always liked that tree of yours he said even before you told me about it oh dad its okay ill get over it no julianna no you wont i started crying it was just a tree i never want you to convince yourself of that
Document 13
you and i both know it isnt true but dad bear with me a minute would you he took a deep breath i want the spirit of that tree to be with you always i want you to remember how you felt when you were up there he hesitated a moment then handed me the painting so i made this for you i pulled off the towel and there was my tree my beautiful majestic sycamore tree through the branches hed painted the fire of sunrise and it seemed to me i could feel the wind and way up in the tree was a tiny girl looking off into the distance her cheeks flushed with wind with joy with magic dont cry julianna i want it to help you not hurt you i wiped the tears from my cheeks and gave a mighty sniff thank you daddy i choked out thank you i hung the painting across the room from my bed its the first thing i see every morning and the last thing i see every night and now that i can look at it without crying i see more than the tree and what being up in its branches meant to me i see the day that my view of things around me started changing brawkbrawkbrawk eggs scare me chickens too and buddy you can laugh at that all you want but im being dead serious here it started in the sixth grade with eggs and a snake and the baker brothers the baker brothers names are matt and mike but even now i cant tell you which ones which you never see one without the other and even though theyre not twins they do look and sound pretty much the same and theyre both in lynettas class so maybe one of them got held back although i cant exactly see a teacher voluntarily having either of those maniacs two years in a row regardless matt and mike are the ones who taught me that snakes eat eggs and when i say they eat eggs im talking they eat them raw and shellon whole i probably wouldve gone my entire life without this little bit of reptilian trivia if it hadnt been for lynetta lynetta had this majorleague thing for skyler brown who lives about three blocks down and every chance she got she went down there to hang out while he practiced the drums well boomboomwhap what did i care right but then skyler and julis brothers formed a band which they named mystery pisser when my mom heard about it she completely wigged out what kind of parents would allow their children to be in a band named mystery pisser its vile its disgusting thats the whole point mom lynetta tried to explain it doesnt mean anything its just to get a rise out of old people are you calling me old young lady because its certainly getting a rise out of me lynetta just shrugged implying that my mom could draw her own conclusion go go to your room my mother snapped for what lynetta snapped back i didnt say a thing you know perfectly well what for now you go in there and adjust your attitude young lady so lynetta got another one of her teenage timeouts and after that any time lynetta was two minutes late coming home for dinner my mother would messenger me down to skylers house to drag her home it might have been embarrassing for lynetta but it was worse for me i was still in elementary school and the mystery pisser guys were in high school they were ripe and ragged raging power chords through the neighborhood while i looked like id just gotten back from sunday school id get so nervous going down there that my voice would squeak when id tell lynetta it was time for dinner it literally squeaked but after a while the band dropped mystery from their name and pisser and its entourage got used to me showing up and instead of glaring at me they started saying stuff like hey baby brother come on in hey brycie boy wanna jam this then is how i wound up in skyler browns garage surrounded by high school kids watching a boa constrictor swallow eggs since id already seen it down a rat in the baker brothers bedroom pisser had lost at least some of the element of surprise plus i picked up on the fact that theyd been saving this little show to freak me out and i really didnt want to give them the satisfaction this wasnt easy though because watching a snake swallow an egg is actually much creepier than you might think the boa opened its mouth to an enormous size then just took the egg in and glub we could see it roll down its throat but that wasnt all after the snake had glubbed down three eggs mattormike said so brycie boy hows he gonna digest those i shrugged and tried not to squeak when i answered stomach acid he shook his head and pretended to confide he needs a tree or a leg he grinned at me wanna volunteer yours i backed away a little i could just see that monster try to swallow my leg whole as an after egg chaser nno he laughed and pointed at the boa slithering across the room aw too bad hes going the other way hes gonna use the piano instead the piano what kind of snake was this how could my sister stand being in the same room as these dementos i looked at her and even though she was pretending to be cool with the snake i know lynetta she was totally creeped out by it the snake wrapped itself around the piano leg about three times and then mattormike put his hands up and said shhh shhh everybody quiet here goes the snake stopped moving then flexed and
Document 14
as it flexed we could hear the eggs crunch inside him oh gross the girls wailed whoa dude the guys all said mike and matt smiled at each other real big and said dinner is served i tried to act cool about the snake but the truth is i started having bad dreams about the thing swallowing eggs and rats and cats and me then the reallife nightmare began one morning about two weeks after the boa show in skylers garage juli appears on our doorstep and whats she got in her hands a halfcarton of eggs she bounces around like its christmas saying hiya bryce remember abby and bonnie and clyde and dexter eunice and florence i just stared at her somehow i remembered santas reindeer a little different than that you know my chickens the ones i hatched for the science fair last year oh right how could i forget theyre laying eggs she pushed the carton into my hands here take these theyre for you and your family oh uh thanks i said and closed the door i used to really like eggs especially scrambled with bacon or sausage but even without the little snake incident i knew that no matter what you did to these eggs they would taste nothing but foul to me these eggs came from the chickens that had been the chicks that had hatched from the eggs that had been incubated by juli baker for our fifthgrade science fair it was classic juli she totally dominated the fair and get this her project was all about watching eggs my friend there is not a lot of action to report on when youre incubating eggs youve got your light youve got your container youve got some shredded newspaper and thats it youre done juli though managed to write an inchthick report plus she made diagrams and charts im talking line charts and bar charts and pie charts about the activity of eggs eggs she also managed to time the eggs so that theyd hatch the night of the fair how does a person do that here ive got a liveaction erupting volcano that ive worked pretty stinking hard on and all anybody cares about is julis chicks pecking out of their shells i even went over to take a look for myself and im being completely objective here it was boring they pecked for about five seconds then just lay there for five minutes i got to hear juli jabber away to the judges too she had a pointer can you believe that not a pencil an actual retractable pointer so she could reach across her incubator and tap on this chart or that diagram as she explained the excitement of watching eggs grow for twentyone days the only thing she couldve done to be more overboard was put on a chicken costume and buddy im convinced if shed thought of it she would have done it but hey i was over it it was just juli being juli right but all of a sudden there i am a year later holding a carton of homegrown eggs and im having a hard time not getting annoyed all over again about her stupid blueribbon project when my mother leans out from the hallway and says who was that honey what have you got there eggs i could tell by the look on her face that she was hot to scramble yeah i said and handed them to her but im having cereal she opened the carton then closed it with a smile how nice she said who brought them over juli she grew them grew them well her chickens did oh her smile started falling as she opened the carton again is that so i didnt know she had chickens remember you and dad spent an hour watching them hatch at last years science fair well how do we know therere not chicks inside these eggs i shrugged like i said im having cereal we all had cereal but what we talked about were eggs my dad thought theyd be just fine hed had farmfresh eggs when he was a kid and said they were delicious my mother though couldnt get past the idea that she might be cracking open a dead chick and pretty soon discussion turned to the role of the rooster something me and my cheerios couldve done without finally lynetta said if they had a rooster dont you think wed know dont you think the whole neighborhood would know hmmm we all said good point but then my mom pipes up with maybe they got it de yodeled you know like they debark dogs a deyodeled rooster my dad says like its the most ridiculous thing hes ever heard then he looks at my mom and realizes that hed be way better off going along with her deyodeled idea than making fun of her hmmm he says ive never heard of such a thing but maybe so lynetta shrugs and says to my mom so just ask them why dont you call up mrs baker and ask her oh my mom says well id hate to call her eggs into question it doesnt seem very polite now does it just ask matt or mike i say to lynetta she scowls at me and hisses shut up what whatd i do now havent you noticed i havent been going down there you idiot lynetta my mom says like this is the first time shes heard my sister talk to me or something well its true how can he not have noticed i was going to ask you about that honey did something happen lynetta stands up and shoves her chair in like you care she snaps and charges

soon the yards full of birds and all we can see of juli is her poopcovered shoes thats not all we can hear though shes warbling inside that coop going i dont need money no fortune or faaayayame i got all the riches baby anyone can claim well i guess youd say what can make me feel this way my girls talkin bout my little girurrls my girls at this point i wasnt checking the chickens out for rubbery red stuff or feathers i was looking at the bottom of juli bakers feet wondering how in the world a person could be so happy tunneling through a dilapidated chicken coop with poop stuck all over her shoes garrett got me back on track theyre all chickens he says look at em i quit checking out julis shoes and started checking out birds the first thing i did was count them onetwothreefourfivesix all accounted for after all how could anyone forget shed hatched six it was the alltime school record everyone in the county had heard about that but i was not really sure how to ask garrett about what he had said yeah they were all chickens but what did that mean i sure didnt want him coming down on me again but it still didnt make sense finally i asked him you mean theres no rooster correctomundo how can you tell he shrugged roosters strut strut thats right and look none of them have long feathers or very much of that rubbery red stuff he nodded yeah theyre definitely all chickens that night my father got right to the point so son mission accomplished he asked as he stabbed into a mountain of fettuccine and whirled his fork around i attacked my noodles too and gave him a smile uhhuh i said as i sat up tall to deliver the news theyre all chickens the turning of his fork came to a grinding halt and i could tell something was wrong but i didnt know what i tried to keep the smile plastered on my face as i said and what he rested his fork and stared at me is that what she said theyre all chickens uh not exactly then exactly what did she say uh she didnt exactly say anything meaning meaning i went over there and took a look for myself i tried very hard to sound like this was a major accomplishment but he wasnt buying you didnt ask her i didnt have to garrett knows a lot about chickens and we went over there and found out for ourselves lynetta came back from rinsing the romano sauce off her seven and a half noodles then reached for the salt and scowled at me saying youre the chicken lynetta my mother said be nice lynetta stopped shaking the salt mother he spied you get it he went over there and looked over the fence are you saying youre okay with that my mom turned to me bryce is that true everyone was staring at me now and i felt like i had to save face whats the big deal you told me to find out about her chickens and i found out about her chickens brawkbrawkbrawk my sister whispered my father still wasnt eating and what you found out he said like he was measuring every word was that theyre all chickens right he sighed then took that bite of noodles and chewed it for the longest time it felt like i was sinking fast but i couldnt figure out why so i tried to bail out with and you guys can go ahead and eat those eggs but theres no way im going to touch them so dont even ask my mothers looking back and forth from my dad to me while she eats her salad and i can tell shes waiting for him to address my adventure as a neighborhood operative but since hes not saying anything she clears her throat and says whys that because theres well theres i dont know how to say this nicely just say it my father snaps well theres you know excrement everywhere oh gross my sister says throwing down her fork you mean chicken droppings my mother asks yeah theres not even a lawn its all dirt and uh you know chicken turds the chickens walk in it and peck through it and oh gross lynetta wails well its true lynetta stands up and says you expect me to eat after this and stalks out of the room lynetta you have to eat something my mother calls after her no i dont she shouts back then a second later she sticks her head back into the dining room and says and dont expect me to eat any of those eggs either mother does the word salmonella mean anything to you lynetta takes off down the hall and my mother says salmonella she turns to my father do you suppose they could have salmonella i dont know patsy im more concerned that our son is a coward a coward rick please bryce is no such thing hes a wonderful child whos whos afraid of a girl dad im not afraid of her she just bugs me why you know why she bugs you too shes over the top about everything bryce i asked you to conquer your fear but all you did was give in to it if you were in love with her that would be one thing love is something to be afraid of but this this is embarrassing so she talks too much so shes too enthused about every little thing so what get in get your question answered and get out stand up to her for cryin out loud rick my mom was saying rick calm down he did find out what you asked him to no he didnt what do you mean he tells me theyre all chickens of course theyre all

chickens the question is how many are hens and how many are roosters i could almost hear the click in my brain and man i felt like a complete doofus no wonder he was disgusted with me i was an idiot they were all chickens duuh garrett acted like he was some expert on chickens and he didnt know diddlysquat why had i listened to him but it was too late my dad was convinced i was a coward and to get me over it he decided that what i should do was take the carton of eggs back to the bakers and tell them we didnt eat eggs or that we were allergic to them or something then my mom butts in with what are you teaching him here rick none of that is true if he returns them shouldnt he tell them the truth what that youre afraid of salmonella poisoning me arent you a little concerned too patsy thats not the point the point is i will not have a coward for a son but teaching him to lie fine then just throw them away but from now on i expect you to look that little tiger square in the eye you hear me yes sir okay then i was off the hook for all of about eight days then there she was again at seven in the morning bouncing up and down on our porch with eggs in her hands hi bryce here you go i tried to look her square in the eye and tell her no thanks but she was so darned happy and i wasnt really awake enough to tackle the tiger she wound up pushing another carton into my hands and i wound up ditching them in the kitchen trash before my father sat down to breakfast this went on for two years two years and it got to a point where it was just part of my morning routine id be on the lookout for juli so i could whip the door open before she had the chance to knock or ring the bell and then id bury the eggs in the trash before my dad showed up then came the day i blew it julid actually been making herself pretty scarce because it was around the time theyd taken the sycamore tree down but suddenly one morning she was back on our doorstep delivering eggs i took them as usual and i went to chuck them as usual but the kitchen trash was so full that there wasnt any room for the carton so i put it on top picked up the trash and beat it out the front door to empty everything into the garbage can outside well guess whos just standing there like a statue on my porch the egg chick i about spilled the trash all over the porch what are you still doing here i asked her ii dont know i was just thinking about what i was desperate i needed a distraction some way around her with this garbage before she noticed what was sitting right there on topshe looked away like she was embarrassed juli baker embarrassed i didnt think it was possible whatever the golden opportunity to whip a soggy magazine over the egg carton had presented itself and buddy i took it then i tried to make a fast break for the garbage can in the side yard only she bodyblocked me seriously she stepped right in my way and put her arms out like shes guarding the goal she chased me and blocked me again what happened she wants to know did they break perfect why hadnt i thought of that yeah juli i told her and im real sorry about that but what im thinking is please god oh please god let me make it to the garbage can god mustve been sleeping in juli tackled the trash and pulled out her precious little carton of eggs and she could tell right off that they werent broken they werent even cracked she stood frozen with the eggs in her hands while i dumped the rest of the trash why did you throw them out she asked but her voice didnt sound like juli bakers voice it was quiet and shaky so i told her we were afraid of salmonella poisoning because her yard was a mess and that we were just trying to spare her feelings i told it to her like we were right and she was wrong but i felt like a jerk a complete cluckfaced jerk then she tells me that a couple of neighbors have been buying eggs off her buying them and while im coming to grips with this incredible bit of news she whips out her mental calculator do you realize ive lost over a hundred dollars giving these eggs to you then she races across the street in a flood of tears as much as i tried to tell myself that i hadnt asked her for the eggsi hadnt said we wanted them or needed them or liked themthe fact was id never seen juli cry before not when shed broken her arm in pe not when shed been teased at school or ditched by her brothers not even when theyd cut down the sycamore tree im pretty sure she cried then but i didnt actually see it to me juli baker had always been too tough to cry i went down to my room to pack my stuff for school feeling like the biggest jerk to ever hit the planet id been sneaking around throwing out eggs for over two years avoiding her avoiding my father what did that make me why hadnt i just stood up and said no thanks dont want em dont need em dont like em give them to the snake why dont you something was i really afraid of hurting her feelings or was i afraid of

her the eggs after they cut down the sycamore tree it seemed like everything else fell apart too champ died and then i found out about the eggs it was champs time to go and even though i still miss him i think its been easier for me to deal with his death than it has been for me to deal with the truth about the eggs i still cannot believe it about the eggs the eggs came before the chickens in our case but the dog came before them both one night when i was about six years old dad came home from work with a fullgrown dog tied down in the back of his truck someone had hit it in the middle of an intersection and dad had stopped to see how badly it was hurt then he noticed that the poor thing was skinny as a rail and didnt have any tags starving and completely disoriented he told my mother can you imagine someone abandoning their dog like that the whole family had converged on the front porch and i could hardly contain myself a dog a wonderful happy panty dog i realize now that champ was never much of a looker but when youre six any dogno matter how mangy is a glorious huggable creature he looked pretty good to my brothers too but from the way my mothers face was pinched i could tell she was thinking abandon this dog oh i can see it i can definitely see it what she said though was simply there is no room for that animal in this house trina my dad said its not a matter of ownership its a matter of compassion youre not springing it on me as a a pet then that is definitely not my intention well then what do you intend to do give him a decent meal a bath then maybe well place an ad and find him a home she eyed him from across the threshold therell be no maybe about it my brothers said we dont get to keep him thats right but moom they moaned its not open to discussion she said he gets a bath he gets a meal he gets an ad in the paper my father put one arm around matts shoulder and the other around mikes someday boys well get a puppy my mother was already heading back inside but over her shoulder came not until you learn to keep your room neat boys by the end of the week the dog was named champ by the end of the next week hed made it from the backyard into the kitchen area and not too long after that he was all moved in it seemed nobody wanted a fullgrown dog with a happy bark nobody but fourfifths of the baker family anyway then my mother started noticing an odor a mysterious odor of indeterminate origin we all admitted we smelled it too but where my mother was convinced it was eau de champ we disagreed she had us bathing him so often that it couldnt possibly be him we each sniffed him out pretty good and he smelled perfectly rosy my personal suspicion was that matt and mike were the ones not bathing enough but i didnt want to get close enough to sniff them and since our camp was divided on just who the culprit or culprits were the odor was dubbed the mystery smell whole dinnertime discussions revolved around the mystery smell which my brothers found amusing and my mother did not then one day my mother cracked the case and she might have cracked champs skull as well if my dad hadnt come to the rescue and shooed him outside mom was fuming i told you it was him the mystery smell comes from the mystery pisser did you see that did you see that he just squirted on the end table my father raced with a roll of paper towels to where champ had been and said where where is it all of three drops were dripping down the table leg there my mother said pointing a shaky finger at the wetness there dad wiped it up then checked the carpet and said it was barely a drop exactly my mother said with her hands on her hips which is why ive never been able to find anything that dog stays outside from now on do you hear me he is no longer allowed in this house how about the garage i asked can he sleep in there and have him tag everything thats out there no mike and matt were grinning at each other mystery pisser that could be the name for our band yeah cool band my mother asked wait a minute what band but they were already flying down to their room laughing about the possibilities for a logo my father and i spent the rest of the day sniffing out and destroying criminal evidence my dad used a spray bottle of ammonia i followed up with lysol we did try to recruit my brothers but they wound up getting into a spraybottle fight which got them locked in their room which of course was fine with them so champ became an outside dog and he might have been our only pet ever if it hadnt been for my fifthgrade science fair everyone around me had great project ideas but i couldnt seem to come up with one then our teacher mrs brubeck took me aside and told me about a friend of hers who had chickens and how she could get me a fertilized egg for my project but i dont know anything about hatching an egg i told her she smiled and put her arm around my shoulders you dont have to be an immediate expert at everything juli the idea here is to learn something new but what if it dies then it dies

document your work scientifically and youll still get an a if thats what youre worried about an a being responsible for the death of a baby chickthats what i was worried about suddenly there was real appeal in building a volcano or making my own neoprene or demonstrating the various scientific applications of gear ratios but the ball was in motion and mrs brubeck would have no more discussion about it she pulled the beginners guide to raising chickens from her bookshelf and said read the section on artificial incubation and set yourself up tonight ill get you an egg tomorrow but dont worry so much juli she said we do this every year and its always one of the best projects at the fair i said but but she was gone off to put an end to some other students battle with indecision that night i was more worried than ever id read the chapter on incubation at least four times and was still confused about where to start i didnt happen to have an old aquarium lying around we didnt happen to have an incubation thermometer would a deepfry model work i was supposed to control humidity too or horrible things would happen to the chick too dry and the chick couldnt peck out too wet and it would die of mushy chick disease mushy chick disease my mother being the sensible person that she is told me to tell mrs brubeck that i simply wouldnt be hatching a chick have you considered growing beans she asked me my father however understood that you cant refuse to do your teachers assignment and he promised to help an incubators not difficult to build well make one after dinner how my father knows exactly where things are in our garage is one of the wonders of the universe how he knew about incubators however was revealed to me while he was drilling a oneinch hole in an old scrap of plexiglas i raised a duck from an egg when i was in high school he grinned at me science fair project a duck yes but the principle is the same for all poultry keep the temperature constant and the humidity right turn the egg several times a day and in a few weeks youll have yourself a little peeper he handed me a lightbulb and an extension cord with a socket attached fasten this through the hole in the plexiglas ill find some thermometers some we need more than one we have to make you a hygrometer a hygrometer to check the humidity inside the incubator its just a thermometer with wet gauze around the bulb i smiled no mushy chick disease he smiled back precisely by the next afternoon i had not one but six chicken eggs incubating at a cozy degrees fahrenheit they dont all make it juli mrs brubeck told me hope for one the records three the grades in the documentation be a scientist good luck and with that she was off documentation of what i had to turn the eggs three times a day and regulate the temperature and humidity but aside from that what was there to do that night my father came out to the garage with a cardboard tube and a flashlight he taped the two together so that the light beam was forced straight out the tube let me show you how to candle an egg he said then switched off the garage light id seen a section on candling eggs in mrs brubecks book but i hadnt really read it yet why do they call it that i asked him and why do you do it people used candles to do this before they had incandescent lighting he held an egg up to the cardboard tube the light lets you see through the shell so you can watch the embryo develop then you can cull the weak ones if necessary kill them cull them remove the ones that dont develop properly but wouldnt that also kill them he looked at me leaving an egg you should cull might have disastrous results on the healthy ones why wouldnt it just not hatch he went back to lighting up the egg it might explode and contaminate the other eggs with bacteria explode between mushy chick disease exploding eggs and culling this project was turning out to be the worst then my father said look here julianna you can see the embryo he held the flashlight and egg out so i could see i looked inside and he said see the dark spot there in the middle with all the veins leading to it the thing that looks like a bean thats it suddenly it felt real this egg was alive i quickly checked the rest of the group there were little bean babies in all of them surely they had to live surely they would all make it dad can i take the incubator inside it might get too cold out here at night dont you think i was going to suggest the same thing why dont you prop open the door ill carry it for you for the next two weeks i was completely consumed with the growing of chicks i labeled the eggs a b c d e and f but before long they had names too abby bonnie clyde dexter eunice and florence every day i weighed them candled them and turned them i even thought it might be good for them to hear some clucking so for a while i did that too but clucking is tiring it was much easier to hum around my quiet little flock so i did that instead soon i was humming without even thinking about it because when i was around my eggs i was happy i read the beginners guide to raising chickens cover to cover twice for my project i drew diagrams of the various stages of an embryos development

i made a giant chicken poster i graphed the daily fluctuations in temperature and humidity and i made a line chart documenting the weight loss of each egg on the outside eggs were boring but i knew what was happening on the inside then two days before the science fair i was candling bonnie when i noticed something i called my dad into my room and said look dad look at this is that the heart beating he studied it for a moment then smiled and said let me get your mother so the three of us crowded around and watched bonnies heart beat and even my mother had to admit that it was absolutely amazing clyde was the first to pip and of course he did it right before i had to leave for school his little beak cracked through and while i held my breath and waited he rested and rested finally his beak poked through again but almost right away he rested again how could i go to school and just leave him this way what if he needed my help surely this was a valid reason to stay home at least for a little while my father tried to assure me that hatching out could take all day and that thered be plenty of action left after school but id have none of that oh nonono i wanted to see abby and bonnie and clyde and dexter and eunice and florence come into the world every single one of them i cant miss the hatch i told him not even a second of it so take it to school with you my mother said mrs brubeck shouldnt mind after all this was her idea sometimes it pays to have a sensible mother id just set up for the science fair early thats what id do i packed up my entire operation posters charts and all and got a ride to school from my mom mrs brubeck didnt mind a bit she was so busy helping kids with their projects that i got to spend nearly the entire day watching the hatch clyde and bonnie were the first ones out it was disappointing at first because they just lay there all wet and matted looking exhausted and ugly but by the time abby and dexter broke out bonnie and clyde were fluffing up looking for action the last two took forever but mrs brubeck insisted that i leave them alone and that worked out pretty great because they hatched out during the fair that night my whole family came and even though matt and mike only watched for about two minutes before they took off to look at some other demonstration my mom and dad stuck around for the whole thing mom even picked bonnie up and nuzzled her that night after it was all over and i was packing up to go home mom asked so do these go back to mrs brubeck now do what go back to mrs brubeck i asked her the chicks juli youre not planning to raise chickens are you to be honest i hadnt thought beyond the hatch my focus had been strictly on bringing them into the world but she was righthere they were six fluffy little adorable chicks each of which had a name and i could already tell its own unique personality ii dont know i stammered ill ask mrs brubeck i tracked down mrs brubeck but i was praying that she didnt want me to give them back to her friend after all id hatched them id named them id saved them from mushy chick disease these little peepers were mine to my relief and my mothers horror mrs brubeck said they were indeed mine all mine have fun she said then zipped off to help heidi dismantle her exhibit on bernoullis law mom was quiet the whole way home and i could tellshe wanted chickens like she wanted a tractor and a goat please mom i whispered as we parked at the curb please she covered her face where are we going to raise chickens juli where in the backyard i didnt know what else to suggest what about champ theyll get along mom ill teach him i promise my dad said softly theyre pretty selfsufficient trina but then the boys piped up with champll piss em to death mom and suddenly they were on a roll yeah but you wont even notice cause theyre yellow already whoa yellow alreadycool name that could work but wait people might think we mean our bellies oh yeah forget that yeah just let him kill the chicks my brothers looked at each other with enormous eyes and started up all over again kill the chicks thats it get it you mean like were chick killers or like we kill the chicks dad turned around and said out both of you get out go find a name elsewhere so they scrambled out and the three of us sat in the car with only the gentle peeppeep peep from my little flock breaking the silence finally my mother heaved a heavy sigh and said they dont cost much to keep do they my dad shook his head they eat bugs trina and a little feed theyre very low maintenance bugs really what sort of bugs earwigs worms rolypolys probably spiders if they can catch them i think they eat snails too seriously my mother smiled well in that case oh thank you mom thank you and thats how we wound up with chickens what none of us thought of was that six chickens scratching for bugs not only gets rid of bugs it also tears up grass within six months there was nothing whatsoever left of our yard what we also didnt think of was that chicken feed attracts mice and mice attract cats feral cats champ was pretty good at keeping the cats out of the yard but theyd

hang around the front yard or the side yard just waiting for him to snooze so they could sneak in and pounce on some tender little mousy vittles then my brothers started trapping the mice which i thought was just to help out i didnt suspect a thing until the day i heard my mother screaming from the depths of their room they were it turns out raising a boa constrictor moms foot came down in a big way and i thought she was going to throw us out lock stock and boa but then i made the most amazing discoverychickens lay eggs beautiful shiny creamy white eggs i first found one under bonnie then clydewhom i immediately renamed clydetteand one more in florences bed eggs i raced inside to show my mom and after a brief moment of blinking at them she withered into a chair no she whimpered no more chicks theyre not chicks mom theyre eggs she was still looking quite pale so i sat in the chair next to her and said we dont have a rooster oh the color was coming back to her cheeks is that so ive never heard a cockadoodledo have you she laughed blessing i guess ive forgotten to count she sat up a little and took an egg from my palm eggs huh how many do you suppose theyll lay i have no idea as it turns out my hens laid more eggs than we could eat at first we tried to keep up but soon we were tired of boiling and pickling and deviling and my mother started complaining that all these free eggs were costing her way too much then one afternoon as i was collecting eggs our neighbor mrs stueby leaned over the side fence and said if you ever have any extra id be happy to buy them from you really i asked most certainly nothing quite like freerange eggs two dollars a dozen sound fair to you two dollars a dozen i laughed and said sure okay then whenever you have some extras just bring em over mrs helms and i got to discussing it last night on the phone but i asked you first so make sure you offer em up to me before her okay juli sure thing mrs stueby between mrs stueby and mrs helms three doors down my egg overflow problem was solved and maybe i shouldve turned the money over to my mother as payment for having destroyed the backyard but one nonsense julianna its yours was all it took for me to start squirreling it away then one day as i was walking down to mrs helms house mrs loski drove by she waved and smiled and i realized with a pang of guilt that i wasnt being very neighborly about my eggs she didnt know that mrs helms and mrs stueby were paying me for these eggs she probably thought i was delivering them out of the kindness of my heart and maybe i shouldve been giving the eggs away but id never had a steady income before allowance at our house is a hitormiss sort of thing usually a miss and earning money from my eggs gave me this secret happy feeling which i was reluctant to have the kindness of my heart encroach upon but the more i thought about it the more i realized that mrs loski deserved some free eggs she had been a good neighbor to us lending us supplies when we ran out unexpectedly and being late to work herself when my mother needed a ride because our car wouldnt start a few eggs now and again it was the least i could do there was also the decidedly blissful possibility of running into bryce and in the chilly sparkle of a new day bryces eyes seemed bluer than ever the way he looked at methe smile the blushit was a bryce i didnt get to see at school the bryce at school was way more protected by the third time i brought eggs over to the loskis i realized that bryce was waiting for me waiting to pull the door open and say thanks juli and then see you at school it was worth it even after mrs helms and mrs stueby offered me more money per dozen it was still worth it so through the rest of sixth grade through all of seventh grade and most of eighth i delivered eggs to the loskis the very best shiniest eggs went straight to the loskis and in return i got a few moments alone with the worlds most dazzling eyes it was a bargain then they cut down the sycamore tree and two weeks later champ died hed been spending a lot of time sleeping and even though we didnt really know how old he was no one was really surprised when one night dad went out to feed him and discovered he was dead we buried him in the backyard and my brothers put up a cross that reads here lies the mystery pisser pip i was upset and pretty dazed for a while it was raining a lot and i was riding my bike to school to avoid having to take the bus and each day when id get home id retreat to my room lose myself in a novel and simply forget about collecting eggs mrs stueby was the one who got me back on schedule she called to say shed read about the tree in the paper and was sorry about everything that had happened but it had been some time now and she missed her eggs and was worried that my hens might quit laying distress can push a bird straight into a molting and we wouldnt want that feathers everywhere and not an egg in sight im quite allergic to the feathers myself or id probably have a flock of my own but never you

Document 23
saying stuff like no you dont you are coming off whether you like it or not did i feel good about this no my friend i did not yeah their yard was a mess and it was about time someone did something about it but cmon wheres the dad what about matt and mike why juli because id embarrassed her into it thats why i felt worse than ever so i snuck inside and tried to ignore the fact that heres my desk and heres my window and right across the street from me is juli beating up a bush not conducive to concentration no siree bob i got all of zero homework done the next day at school i was trying to get up the nerve to say something to her but i never even got the chance she wouldnt let me get anywhere near her then on the ride home i had this thought it kind of freaked me out at first but the more i played with it the more i figured that yeah helping her with the yard would make up for my having been such a jerk assuming she didnt boss me too much and assuming she didnt decide to get all gooeyeyed or something stupid like that no id go up and just tell her that i felt bad for being a jerk and i wanted to make it up to her by helping her cut back some bushes period end of story and if she still wanted to be mad at me after that then fine that was her problem my problem was i never got the chance i came trekking down from the bus stop to find my grandfather doing my good deed now jump back this was not something i could immediately absorb my grandfather did not do yard work at least hed never offered to help me out my grandfather lived in house slippers whered he get those work boots and those jeans and that flannel shirt what was up with those i crouched behind a neighbors hedge and watched them for ten or fifteen minutes and man the longer i watched the madder i got my grandfather had already said more to her in this little slice of time than hed said to me the whole year and a half hed been living with us what was his deal with juli baker i took the back way home which involved climbing two fences and kicking off the neighbors stupid little terrier but it was worth it considering i avoided the garden party across the street again i got no homework done the more i watched them the madder i got i was still a cluckfaced jerk while juli was laughing it up with my grandfather had i ever seen him smile really smile i dont think so but now he was knee high in nettles laughing at dinner that night hed showered and changed back into his regular clothes and house slippers but he didnt look the same it was like someone had plugged him in and turned on the light good evening he said as he sat down with the rest of us oh patsy that looks delicious well dad my mom said with a laugh your excursion across the street seems to have done you a world of good yeah my father said patsy tells me youve been over there all afternoon if you were in the mood for home improvement projects why didnt you just say so my father was just joking around but i dont think my grandfather took it that way he helped himself to a cheesestuffed potato and said pass the salt wont you bryce so there was this definite tension between my father and my grandfather but i think if dad had dropped the subject right then the vibe wouldve vanished dad didnt drop it though instead he said so whys the girl the one whos finally doing something about their place my grandfather salted his potato very carefully then looked across the table at me ahoh i thought ah oh in a flash i knew those stupid eggs were not behind me two years of sneaking them in the trash two years of avoiding discussion of juli and her eggs and her chickens and her earlymorning visits and for what granddad knew i could see it in his eyes in a matter of seconds hed crack open the truth and id be as good as fried enter a miracle my grandfather petrified me for a minute with his eyes but then turned to my father and said she wants to is all a raging river of sweat ran down my temples and as my father said well its about time someone did my grandfather looked back at me and i knewhe was not going to let me forget this wed just had another conversation only this time i was definitely not dismissed after the dishes were cleared i retreated to my room but my grandfather came right in closed the door behind him and then sat on my bed he did this all without making a sound no squeaking no clanking no scraping no breathing i swear the guy moved through my room like a ghost and of course im banging my knee and dropping my pencil and deteriorating into a pathetic pool of jello but i tried my best to sound cool as i said hello granddad come to check out the digs he pinched his lips together and looked at nothing but me i cracked look granddad i know i messed up i shouldve just told her but i couldnt and i kept thinking theyd stop i mean how long can a chicken lay eggs those things hatched in the fifth grade that was like three years ago dont they eventually run out and what was i supposed to do tell her mom was afraid of salmonella poisoning and
Document 24
dad wanted me to tell her we were allergiccmon whos going to buy that so i just kept you know throwing them out i didnt know she couldve sold them i thought they were just extras he was nodding but very slowly i sighed and said thank you for not saying anything about it at dinner i owe you he pulled my curtain aside and looked across the street ones character is set at an early age son the choices you make now will affect you for the rest of your life he was quiet for a minute then dropped the curtain and said i hate to see you swim out so far you cant swim back yes sir he frowned and said dont yessir me bryce then he stood and added just think about what ive said and the next time youre faced with a choice do the right thing it hurts everyone less in the long run with that poof he was gone the next day i went to shoot some hoops at garretts after school and when his mom dropped me off later that afternoon my granddad didnt even notice he was too busy being joe carpenter in julis front yard i tried to do my homework at the breakfast bar but my mom came home from work and started being all chatty and then lynetta appeared and the two of them started fighting about whether lynettas makeup made her look like a wounded raccoon lynetta i swear shell never learn i packed up my stuff and escaped to my room which of course was a total waste theyve got a saw revving and wailing across the street and in between cuts i can hear the whack whack whack whack whack whack of a hammer i look out the window and theres juli spitting out nails and slamming them in place no kidding shes got nails lined up between her lips like steel cigarettes and shes swinging that hammer fullarc way above her head driving nails into pickets like theyre going into butter for a split second there i saw my head as the recipient of her hammer cracking open like humpty dumpty i shuddered and dropped the curtain ditched the homework and headed for the tv they handymanned all week and every night granddad would come in with rosy cheeks and a huge appetite and compliment my mom on what a great cook she was then saturday happened and the last thing i wanted was to spend the day at home while my grandfather churned up dirt and helped plant julis yard mom tried to get me to do our own yard but i would have felt ridiculous micromowing our grass with granddad and juli making real changes right across the street so i locked myself in my room and called garrett he wasnt home and everybody else i called had stuff they had to do and hitting up mom or dad for a ride to the movies or the mall was hopeless theyd tell me i was supposed to be doing the yard what i was was stuck and what i wound up doing was looking out the stupid window at juli and my grandfather it was a totally lame thing to do but thats what i did i got nailed doing it too by my grandfather and he of course had to point me out to juli which made me feel another two inches shorter i dropped the curtain and blasted out the back door and over the fence i had to get out of there i swear i walked ten miles that day and i dont know who i was madder at my grandfather juli or me what was wrong with me if i wanted to make it up to juli why didnt i just go over there and help what was stopping me i wound up at garretts house and man id never been so glad to see anyone in my life leave it to garrett to get your mind off anything important that dudes the master we went out back and shot hoops watched the tube and talked about hitting the water slides this summer and when i got home there was juli sprinkling the yard she saw me all right but she didnt wave or smile or anything she just looked away normally what id do in that situation is maybe pretend like i hadnt seen her or give a quick wave and charge inside but shed been mad at me for what seemed like ages she hadnt said word one to me since the morning of the eggs shed completely dissed me in math a couple days before when id smiled at her trying to tell her i was sorry she didnt smile back or nod or anything she just turned away and never looked back i even waited for her outside the classroom to say something anything about her fixing up the yard and how bad i felt but she ditched me out the other door and after that anytime i got anywhere near her shed find some way to skate around me so there she was watering the yard making me feel like a jerk and id had enough of it i went up to her and said its looking real good juli nice job thanks she said without smiling chet did most of it chet i thought chet what was she doing calling my grandfather by his first name look juli i said trying to get on with why i was there im sorry for what i did she looked at me for a second then went back to watching the water spray across the dirt finally she said i still dont get it bryce why didnt you just tell me ii dont know it was dumb i should have and i shouldnt have said anything about the yard either it was you know out of

line i was already feeling better a lot better then juli says well maybe its all for the better and starts bouncing up and down on the balls of her feet acting more like her old self doesnt it look great i learned so much from chet its amazing you are so lucky i dont even have grandparents anymore oh i said not knowing what to say i do feel sorry for him though he sure misses your grandmother then she laughs and shakes her head saying can you believe it he says i remind him of her what yeah she laughs again thats what i said but he meant it in a nice way i looked at juli and tried to picture my grandmother as an eighth grader it was hopeless i mean julis got long fluffy brown hair and a nose full of freckles where my grandmother had always been some variety of blond and my grandmother had used powder puffy white powder shed put it on her face and in her hair in her slippers and on her chest that woman powdered everything i could not see juli coated in powder okay maybe gun powder but the white perfumy stuff forget it i guess i was staring because juli says look i didnt say it he did i just thought it was nice thats all yeah whatever well good luck with the grass im sure itll come up great then i totally surprised myself by saying knowing you youll get em all to hatch i didnt say it mean or anything i really meant it i laughed and then she laughed and thats how i left hersprinkling her soontobe sod smiling i hadnt been in such a good mood in weeks the eggs were finally behind me i was absolved relieved happy it took me a few minutes at the dinner table to realize that i was the only one who was lynetta had on her usual pout so that wasnt it but my fathers idea of saying hello was to lay into me about the lawn no sweat i told him ill do it tomorrow all that got me was a scowl then mom says to my granddad you tired tonight dad i hadnt even noticed him sitting there like a stone yeah my father tosses down the table at him that girl working you too hard my grandfather straightens his fork on his napkin and says that girl is named juli and no she isnt working me too hard as you so callously put it callous me my dad laughs and says developed quite a soft spot for that girl havent you even lynetta let her pout go for a minute these were fighting words and everyone knew it mom nudged dad with her foot but that only made things worse no patsy i want to know why your father has the energy and inclination to befriend a complete stranger when hes never done so much as toss a baseball around with his own grandson well yeah i thought but then i remembered i owed my grandfather owed him bigtime without thinking i said take it easy dad juli just reminds him of grandma everyone clammed up and stared at me so i looked at my grandfather and said uh isnt that right granddad he nodded and rearranged his fork some more of rene my father looked at my mother and then at granddad she cant possibly my granddad closed his eyes and said its her spirit that reminds me of rene her spirit my father says like hes talking to a lying kindergartner yes her spirit my grandfathers quiet for a minute then asks do you know why the bakers havent fixed up the yard until now why sure theyre trash thats why theyve got a beatup house two beatup cars and a beatup yard they are not trash rick they are good honest hardworking people who have absolutely no pride in how they present themselves to the rest of the world weve lived across the street from those people for over six years and there is no excuse for the state theyre in no my grandfather takes a deep breath and seems to weigh things in his mind for a few seconds then he says tell me this rick if you had a brother or sister or child who had a severe mental or physical handicap what would you do it was like my granddad had passed gas in church my fathers face pinched his head shook and finally he said chet what does that have to do with anything my grandfather looks at him for a minute then quietly says julis father has a retarded brother and my father interrupts him with a laugh well that explains a lot doesnt it explainsa lot my grandfather asks quietly calmly sure it explains why those people are the way they are he grins around the table at us must run in the family everyone looks at him lynettas jaw drops and for once shes speechless my mother says rick but all my father can do is laugh a nervous kind of laugh and say it was just a joke i mean obviously somethings wrong with those people oh excuse me chet i forgot the girl reminds you of rene rick my mother says again only this time shes mad oh patsy please your fathers being overly dramatic trying to make me feel bad for criticizing our neighbors because theres a retarded relative someplace other people have family troubles and still manage to mow their lawn they should have a little pride in ownership for cryin out loud my grandfathers cheeks are seriously flushed but his voice is rocksteady as he says they dont own that house rick the landlord is supposed to maintain the premises but he doesnt and since julis father is responsible for his brother all their reserves go to his care
Document 26
and obviously it doesnt come cheap very quietly my mom asks dont they have government facilities for that kind of thing i dont know the details patsy maybe there are no government facilities nearby maybe they thought a private facility was a better place for him to be still my dad says there are government facilities available and if they dont want to go that route thats their choice its not our fault their family had some sort of chromosomal abnormality and i refuse to feel guilty for wanting my grandfather slams his hand on the table and halfstands as he says it had nothing to do with chromosomes rick it was caused by a lack of oxygen at birth he brings his voice down but it makes his words seem even more forceful julis uncle had the umbilical cord wrapped around his neck twice one minute he was a perfect little baby just like your son bryce and the next he was irreversibly damaged my mother was suddenly hysterical in seconds she was bawling her eyes out wailing and my father was all over her trying to calm her down it was no use she basically dissolved right there on the spot lynetta threw her napkin down and muttered this family is a joke and took off then my mother bolted out of the room sobbing into her hands and my father raced after her throwing my grandfather the wickedest look id ever seen that left granddad and me and a table full of cold food wow i finally said i had no idea you still dont he told me what do you mean he sat there like granite for a minute then leaned across the table toward me and said why do you suppose that upset your mother so much ii dont know i gave a halfhearted grin and said because shes female he smiled but just barely no shes upset because she knows that she could very well be standing in mr bakers shoes right now i thought about it a minute and finally asked did her brother have the cord around his neck when he was born he shook his head well then he leaned forward even farther and whispered you did i did he nodded twice but the doctor who delivered you was on the ball plus apparently there was some slack in the cord so he was able to loop it off as you came out you didnt hang yourself coming into the world but it could very easily have gone the other way if id been told years or even weeks ago that id come down the chute noosed and ready to hang id have made some kind of joke about it or more likely id have said yeah thats nice now can you spare me the discussion but after everything that had happened i was really freaking out and i couldnt escape the questions tidalwaving my brain where would i be if things had been different what would they have done with me from the way my dad was talking he wouldnt have had much use for me thats for sure hed have stuck me in a nuthouse somewhere any where and forgotten about me but then i thought no im his kid he wouldnt do that would he i looked around at everything we had the big house the white carpet the antiques and artwork and stuff that was everywhere would they have given up all the stuff to make my life more pleasant i doubted it and man i doubted it bigtime id have been an embarrassment something to try to forget about how things looked had always been a biggie to my parents especially to my dad very quietly my granddad said you cant dwell on what might have been bryce then like he could read my mind he added and its not fair to condemn him for something he hasnt done i nodded and tried to get a grip but i wasnt doing a very good job of it then he said by the way i appreciated your comment before what i asked but my throat was feeling all pinched and swollen about your grandmother how did you know that i shook my head and said juli told me oh you spoke with her then yeah actually i apologized to her well and i was feeling a lot better about everything but now god i feel like such a jerk again dont you apologized and thats what matters he stood up and said say im in the mood for a walk want to join me go for a walk what i wanted to do was go to my room lock the door and be left alone i find it really helps to clear the mind he said and thats when i realized that this wasnt just a walk this was an invitation to do something together i stood up and said yeah lets get out of here for a guy whod only basically ever said pass the salt to me my granddad turned out to be a real talker we walked our neighborhood and the next neighborhood and the next neighborhood and not only did i find out that my granddad knows a lot of stuff i found out that the guy is funny in a subtle kind of dry way its the stuff he says plus the way he says it its really i dont know cool as we were winding back into our own territory we passed by the house thats going up where the sycamore tree used to be my granddad stopped looked up into the night and said it mustve been a spectacular view i looked up too and noticed for the first time that night that you could see the stars did you ever see her up there i asked him your mother pointed her out to me one time as we drove
Document 27
by it scared me to see her up so high but after i read the article i understood why she did it he shook his head the trees gone but shes still got the spark it gave her know what i mean luckily i didnt have to answer he just grinned and said some of us get dipped in flat some in satin some in gloss he turned to me but every once in a while you find someone whos iridescent and when you do nothing will ever compare as we walked up to our front porch my grandfather put his arm around my shoulder and said it was nice walking with you bryce i enjoyed myself very much me too i told him and we went inside right away we knew wed stepped into a war zone and even though no one was yelling or crying from the look on my parents faces i could tell thered been a major meltdown while my granddad and i were out granddad whispered to me ive got another fence to mend im afraid and headed into the dining room to talk to my parents i wanted nothing to do with that vibe i went straight to my room closed the door and flopped through the darkness onto my bed i lay there awhile and let the dinner disaster play through my mind and when id totally burned a fuse thinking about it i sat up and looked out the window there was a light on somewhere inside the bakers house and the streetlights were glowing but the night still seemed really dense like it was darker than usual and i dont know heavy i leaned closer to the window and looked up into the sky but i couldnt see the stars anymore i wondered if juli had ever been in the sycamore at night among the stars i shook my head flat glossy iridescent what was up with that juli baker had always seemed just plain dusty to me i snapped on my desk lamp and dug the newspaper with the article about juli out of the drawer where id tossed it just like i thought they made it sound like juli was trying to save mount rushmore or something they called her a strong voice in an urban wilderness and a radiant beacon shedding light on the need to curtail continued overdevelopment of our once quaint and tranquil community spare me i mean whats wrong with letting a guy cut down a tree on his own property so he can build a house his lot his tree his decision end of story the piece in the paper was gagme gush except except for the places where they quoted juli maybe it was just in contrast to the reporters slant or something but julis parts didnt come off ohwoeisme like i was expecting they were i dont know deep sitting in that tree was seriously philosophical to her and the odd thing is it all made sense to me she talked about what it felt like to be up in that tree and how it like transcended dimensional space to be held above the earth and brushed by the wind she said its like your heart has been kissed by beauty who in junior high do you know that would put together a sentence like that none of my friends thats for sure there was other stuff too like how something can be so much more than the parts it took to make it and why people need things around them that lift them above their lives and make them feel the miracle of living i wound up reading and rereading her parts wondering when in the world she started thinking like that i mean no kidding juli bakers smart but this was something way beyond straight as a month ago if id read this article i would have chucked it in the trash as complete garbage but for some reason it made sense to me now a lot of sense a month ago i also wouldnt have paid any attention to the picture of juli but now i found myself staring at it not the one of the whole scene that was more emergency rescue equipment than juli the other one on the bottom half of the page someone mustve used a killer telephoto lens because you can tell that shes in the tree but its mostly from the shoulders up shes looking off into the distance and the wind is blowing her hair back like shes at the helm of a ship or something sailing into the sun id spent so many years avoiding juli baker that id never really looked at her and now all of a sudden i couldnt stop this weird feeling started taking over the pit of my stomach and i didnt like it not one bit to tell you the truth it scared the sheetrock out of me i buried the paper under my pillow and tried to remind myself of what a pain juli baker was but my mind started to wander again and pretty soon i had that stupid paper out from under my pillow this was insane what was i doing i made myself shut out the light and go to bed i was slipping man and it was definitely time to get a grip the yard id never been embarrassed by where we lived before id never looked at our house or even our side of the street and said oh i wish we lived in the new developmentthose houses are so much newer so much better this is where id grown up this was my home i was aware of the yard sure my mother had grumbled about it for years but it was a low grumbling not worthy of deep concern or so id supposed but maybe i should have wondered why let the outside go and keep the
Document 28
inside so nice it was spotless inside our house except for the boys room that is mom gave up on that after she discovered the snake if they were old enough to adopt a snake she told my brothers they were old enough to clean their own room matt and mike translated this to keep the door closed and became quite diligent about doing just that besides the yard i also never really wondered about the money or the apparent lack thereof i knew we werent rich but i didnt feel like i was missing anything anything you could buy anyway matt and mike did ask for things a lot but even though my mother would tell them no boys we just cant afford that i took this to mean no boys you dont deserve that or no boys you dont really need that it wasnt until bryce called our home a complete dive that i started really seeing things it wasnt just the yard it was my dads truck my mothers car the family bike that was more rust than steel and the fact that when we did buy something new it always seemed to come from a secondtimearound store plus we never went on vacation ever why was that my father was the hardestworking man in the world and my mother worked for tempservice doing secretarial jobs whenever she could what was all that hard work about if this is where it got you asking my parents whether we were poor seemed incredibly impolite but as the days went by i knew i had to ask just had to every day id ride home from school on our rusty bike pull past the broken fence and patchy yard and think tonight ill ask them tonight but then i wouldnt ask them i just didnt know how then one day i had an idea a way to talk to them about it and maybe help out a little too and since my brothers were working at the music store that night and nobody was saying much of anything at the table i took a deep breath and said i was thinking you know that it wouldnt be hard to fix up the front yard if i could get some nails and a hammer and maybe some paint and how much does grass seed cost it cant be that much right i could plant a lawn and maybe even some flowers my parents stopped eating and stared at me i know how to use a saw and a hammerit could be you know a project my mother quit looking at me and stared at my father instead my father sighed and said the yard is not our responsibility julianna its its not he shook his head and said its mr finnegans whos mr finnegan the man who owns this house i couldnt believe my ears what my father cleared his throat and said the landlord you mean we dont own this house they looked at each other having some private wordless conversation i couldnt decipher finally my father said i didnt realize you didnt know that but but that doesnt make sense arent landlords supposed to come and do things like fix the roof when it leaks and clear the drains when theyre plugged you always do that stuff dad why do you do it when hes supposed to because he sighed its easier than asking him for help but if and my father interrupted me it keeps him from raising the rent but my mother reached over and took my hand sweetheart im sorry if this is a shock i guess we always thought you knew but what about the yard why keep up the inside but not the outside my father frowned and said when we signed the lease he assured us he would fix the fences front and back and plant sod in the front yard obviously that never happened he shook his head its a major undertaking and fencing is not cheap i cant see putting that sort of investment into a property thats not ours plus its the principle of the thing but we live here i whispered and it looks so bad my father studied me julianna what happened nothing daddy i said but he knew i was lying sweetheart he whispered tell me i knew what hed say if i told him and yet i couldnt not tell him not with the way he was looking at me so i took a deep breath and said the loskis have been throwing my eggs away because they were afraid theyd have salmonella because our yard is such a mess my father said oh thats ridiculous but my mother gasped what then she cried did patsy say that i looked down no bryce did but it mustve been a family discussion a boy doesnt come up with that on his own my mother looked for all the world like a doe waiting to be shot through the heart she covered her face with her hands and said i cant go on like this robert things have got to change theyve just got to trina you know im doing the best i can im sorry about the yard im sorry about the situation this isnt the picture i had for my life either but sometimes you have to sacrifice for whats right my mother looked up from her hands and said this is not right for our family your daughter is suffering because we wont fix up our own yard its not our yard how can you say that robert wake up we have lived here for twelve years its not temporary anymore if we ever want to have a decent place with our own yard if were going to help the kids through college or do any of the other things weve promised each other were going to have to move him into government care
Document 29
my father let out a deep sigh and whispered weve discussed this so many times trina in the end you always agree that keeping him at greenhaven is the right thing to do i wanted to say wait what are you talking about who are you talking about but the conversation was flying so fast and furious that i couldnt seem to break in and it wasnt long before they were bickering so badly that it was almost like i wasnt there then in the back of my mind it clicked everything clicked it was my dads brother they were talking about my uncle david to me uncle david was only a name someone my parents had explained to me but not someone id ever actually met and even though i knew my dad visited him i never knew exactly when he never talked about it dad also thought we shouldnt talk about uncle david to others because david was retarded people jump to conclusions hed told me they assume that by association something must also be wrong with you trust me i know so we didnt talk about it not at home not with friends it was almost like there was no uncle david until now now he felt larger than life and i could tell from their argument that he was the reason we didnt have our own house he was the reason we didnt have nice cars or fancy things he was the reason there always seemed to be a cloud of weariness hanging over my parents why did i have to bring up the yard in the first place id never seen my parents fight like this ever i wanted to grab them and say stop it stop it you love each other you do but i just sat there with tears streaming down my face my mother stopped suddenly and whispered we should not be doing this in front of her im sorry julianna my dad said then reached over and held my forearm dont cry none of this is your fault well work it out i promise we will my mother tried to laugh through her tears saying we always have and we always will that night my parents came into my room and talked to me one at a time my father talked about his brother and how much he loved him and how hed promised his parents hed always take care of him my mother talked about how much she loved my father for his strength and kind heart about dreams and reality and the need to count your blessings and she made me cry all over again when she kissed me goodnight and whispered that of all her many blessings i was her best and brightest i felt sorry for my father i felt sorry for my mother but most of all i felt lucky for me that they were mine and in the morning as i rode my rusty bike out the driveway to school i promised myself that when i got home id tackle the yard rented or not this was our home and i was going to help make living here better as it turns out this was easier thought than done first it took me half an hour of rummaging through the garage to find a hammer and a box of nails a saw and some pruners then it took another half hour of standing around to figure out just where to start the actual yard was just clumps of weeds but what about the bordering shrubs should i dig them up or prune them way back were they shrubs or just overgrown weeds and what about the fence should i knock it down or rebuild it maybe i should take out the front end entirely and use the wood to fix up the sides the longer i looked around the more i felt like forgetting the whole thing why bother it wasnt our property mr finnegan should be the one making repairs but then i remembered my mothers words from the night before surely i thought a few bushes and some dilapidated wood couldnt stop someones best and brightest blessing surely not and with that i picked up the clippers and got to work half an hour later i was keeper of the knowledge that one bush equals many branches and that the volume of a bush increases exponentially as its cut and tossed into the middle of a yard it was ridiculous where was i going to put all this stuff mom came home and tried to talk me out of my mission but id have none of it oh nonono id already pruned two bushes down to a respectable size and before long shed see the place was going to look just dandy you didnt get that stubborn streak from me she said but came back outside with a glass of juice and a kiss for my cheek good enough for meby the end of that first day what id made was a big mess but if chaos is a necessary step in the organization of ones universe then i was well on my way at least thats what i tried to tell myself when i flopped into bed that night dead tired and the next afternoon i was busily expanding the chaos of my little universe when i heard a deep voice say thats quite an undertaking young lady the man standing on our sidewalk was bryces grandfather i knew that much but id only ever seen him outside one time all the other times id seen him had been through windows either one in their sitting room or one in their car to me he was just a darkhaired man behind glass having him appear on my sidewalk was like having someone from tv step through the screen and talk to you i know weve seen each other from time to time

he was saying im sorry its taken me over a year to come introduce myself im chester duncan bryces grandfather and you of course are julianna baker he stuck out his hand so i took off my work glove and watched my hand completely disappear inside his as we shook nice to meet you mr duncan i said thinking that this man was way bigger than he looked from the sittingroom window then the strangest thing happened he pulled his own work gloves and a pair of clippers from a back pocket and said are you pruning all of these to the same height oh i said well yes that is what i was thinking although now i dont know do you think it would look better to just take them out he shook his head and said theyre australian tea shrubs theyll prune up nicely and with that he put on his gloves and started clipping at first i didnt know what to say to this man it was very strange to be getting his help but from the way he was acting it was as though i shouldnt have thought a thing of it clipclipclip he went like this was something he really enjoyed doing then i remembered what bryce had said about our yard and suddenly i knew why he was there whats the matter he asked throwing his clippings into my pile did i cut it down too far nno then why the look he asked i dont mean to make you uncomfortable i just thought you might like a little help well i dont i can do this by myself he laughed and said oh i have no doubt about that then got back to clipping you see julianna i read about you in the paper and ive lived across the street from you for over a year now its easy to see that youre a very competent person we both worked quietly for a minute but i found myself throwing the clippings into the pile harder and harder and before long i couldnt stand it i just couldnt stand it i spun on him and said youre here because you feel bad about the eggs arent you well our eggs are perfectly fine weve been eating them for nearly three years and none of us have gotten poisoned mrs stueby and mrs helms seem in good health to me too and the fact of the matter is if you didnt want them you shouldve just told me so his hands fell to his sides and he shook his head as he said eggs poisoned julianna i have no idea what youre talking about inside i was so angry and hurt and embarrassed that i didnt even feel like me im talking about the eggs that ive been bringing over to your house for more than two years eggs that my chickens laid that i couldve sold eggs that your family has been throwing away i was shouting at him shouting at an adult like id never shouted at anyone in my entire life his voice got very quiet im sorry i dont know about any eggs who did you give them to bryce my throat choked closed as i said his name again bryce mr duncan nodded slowly and said well then went back to pruning his bush that probably explains it what do you mean he sighed the boy still has a ways to go i just stared at him not trusting myself with the words sizzling on my tongue oh hes a very handsome boy theres no denying that he said with a frown then he snapped a branch and added the spitting image of his father i shook my head why are you over here mr duncan if you dont think i need the help and youre not feeling bad about the eggs then why would you do this honestly i just looked at him straight in the eye he nodded then said because you remind me of my wife your wife thats right he gave me a little smile and said rene wouldve sat up in that tree with you she wouldve sat there all night and with those two sentences my anger vanished really absolutely shes she died he nodded and i miss her terribly he tossed a branch into the heap and chuckled theres nothing like a headstrong woman to make you happy to be alive the last thing in the world i expected was to become friends with bryces grandfather but by dinnertime i knew so much about him and his wife and the adventures theyd had together that it seemed like id known him for a very long time plus all his stories made the work seem easy when i went in for the night the bushes were all pruned back and except for the enormous heap in the center of the yard things were already looking a whole lot better the next day he was back and when i smiled and said hi mr duncan he smiled back and said call me chet wont you he looked at the hammer in my hand and said i take it were starting on the fence today chet taught me how to plumb a line for the pickets how to hold a hammer down on the end of the handle instead of choking up on it how to calculate an adjusted spacing for the pickets and how to use a level to get the wood exactly vertical we worked on the fence for days and the whole time we worked we talked it wasnt just about his wife either he wanted to know about the sycamore tree and seemed to understand exactly what i meant when i told about the whole being greater than the sum of its parts its that way with people too he said only with people its sometimes that the whole is less than
Document 31
the sum of the parts i thought that was pretty interesting and the next day during school i looked around at the people id known since elementary school trying to figure out if they were more or less than the sum of their parts chet was right a lot of them were less top of the list of course was shelly stalls to look at her youd think she had everything but theres not much solid underneath her mount everest hair and even though shes like a black hole at sucking people in it doesnt take them long to figure out that being friends with her requires fanning the flames of a wildfire ego but of all my classmates the one person i couldnt seem to place was bryce until recently id have said with absolute certainty that he was greaterfar greaterthan the sum of his parts what he did to my heart was sheer inexplicable magic but inexplicable was the operative word here and as i looked across the room at him during math i couldnt help feeling crushed all over again about how hed thrown out my eggs what kind of person would do that then he looked my way and smiled and my heart lurched but i was mad at myself for it how could i still feel this way after what hed done i avoided him the rest of the day but by the end of school there was a tornado inside me tearing me up from one end to the other i jumped on my bike and rode home faster than i ever had before the right pedal clanked against the chain guard and the whole bike rattled and squeaked threatening to collapse into a pile of rusty parts the tornado however was still going strong when i skidded to a halt in our driveway so i transferred pedal power into painting power i pried open the gallon of navajo white my dad had bought me and started slopping paint around chet appeared about ten minutes later my he laughed youve got an enviable amount of energy today dont you no i said brushing back some hair with the back of my hand im just mad he produced his own brush and an empty coffee can uhoh who at myself oh thats a tough one did you do poorly on a test no i i turned to him and said how did you fall in love with your wife he poured some navajo white into his can and smiled ah he said boy problems i do not have boy problems he hesitated but didnt argue instead he said i fell in love with her by mistake by mistake what do you mean i didnt intend to at the time i was engaged to somebody else and in no position to fall in love fortunately for me i saw how blind id been before it was too late blind yes my fiance was very beautiful she had the most magnificent brown eyes and skin like an angel and for a time all i could see was her beauty but then well lets just say i discovered she wasnt a fraction of the person rene was he dipped his brush in the coffee can and stroked a picket with paint its easy to look back and see it and its easy to give the advice but the sad fact is most people dont look beneath the surface until its too late we were quiet a minute but i could see chet thinking and from the furrow in his brow i knew it had nothing to do with my problems im im sorry i brought up your wife i said oh dont be thats all right he shook his head and tried on a smile besides i wasnt thinking of rene i was thinking of someone else someone whos never been able to look beneath the surface at this point i dont suppose i even want her to who was he talking about i wanted to know but i felt it would be crossing some line to ask so we painted pickets in silence at last he turned to me and said get beyond his eyes and his smile and the sheen of his hairlook at whats really there the way he said it sent a chill through me it was as though he knew and suddenly i felt defensive was he telling me his grandson wasnt worth it when it was time to go in for dinner i still didnt feel right but at least the tornado was gone mom said dad was working late and since the boys were off with their friends it was just the two of us she told me that she and dad had talked about it and that they both felt a little strange having chet come over like he was maybe she said they should find a way to pay him for his help i told her i thought chet would find that insulting but the next day she went ahead and insulted him anyway chet said no mrs baker its been my pleasure to help out your daughter on this project and wouldnt hear another word about it the week ended with my dad loading the back of his truck with all the clippings and scraps before he set off for work on saturday morning then chet and i spent the rest of the day hoeing up weeds and raking and readying the dirt for seeding it was on this last day that chet asked your familys not moving are you moving why do you say that oh my daughter brought up the possibility at the dinner table last night she thought that maybe youre fixing up the house because youre getting ready to sell it even though chet and i had talked about a lot of things while we were working i probably wouldnt have told him about

mr finnegan or uncle david or why the yard was such a mess if he hadnt asked me about moving but since he had well i wound up telling him everything and it felt good to talk about it especially about uncle david it felt like blowing a dandelion into the wind and watching all the little seeds float off up and away i was proud of my parents and looking around the front yard i was proud of me too just wait until i got my hands on the backyard then maybe id even paint the house i could do it i could chet was pretty quiet after i told him the story and when mom brought us out sandwiches at lunchtime we sat on the porch and ate without saying a word then he broke the silence by nodding across the street and saying i dont know why he doesnt just come out and say hello who i asked then looked across the street to where hed nodded the curtain in bryces room moved quickly back into place and i couldnt help asking bryce thats the third time ive seen him watching really my heart was fluttering about like a baby bird trying to fly he frowned and said lets finish up and get that seed sown shall we youll want the warmth of the day to help with the germination i was happy to finally be planting the yard but i couldnt help being distracted by bryces window was he watching during the rest of the afternoon i checked more often than id like to admit and im afraid chet noticed too because when we were all done and wed congratulated each other on what was sure to be a finelooking yard he said he may be acting like a coward now but i do hold out hope for the boy a coward what on earth could i say to that i just stood there with the hose in one hand and the spigot valve beneath the other and with that chet waved so long and walked across the street a few minutes later i saw bryce coming down the sidewalk toward his house i did a double take all this time id thought he was inside the house watching and he was really outside walking around i was embarrassed all over again i turned my back on him and concentrated on watering the yard what a fool i was what a complete idiot and i had just built up a nice head of angry steam when i heard its looking good juli nice job it was bryce standing right there on our driveway and suddenly i wasnt mad at me anymore i was mad at him how could he stand there like my supervisor and tell me nice job he had no business saying anything after what hed done i was about to hose him down when he said im sorry for what i did juli it was you know wrong i looked at himinto those brilliant blue eyes and i tried to do what chet had saidi tried to look past them what was behind them what was he thinking was he really sorry or was he just feeling bad about the things hed said it was like looking into the sun though and i had to turn away i couldnt tell you what we talked about after that except that he was nice to me and he made me laugh and after he left i shut off the water and went inside feeling very very strange the rest of the evening i bounced back and forth between upset and uneasy the worst part being i couldnt really put my finger on what exactly i was upset or uneasy about of course it was bryce but why wasnt i just mad hed been such a scoundrel or happy why wasnt i just happy hed come over to our house hed stood on our driveway hed said nice things wed laughed but i wasnt mad or happy and as i lay in bed trying to read i realized that upset had been overshadowed by uneasy i felt as though someone was watching me i got so spooked i even got up and checked out the window and in the closet and under the bed but still the feeling didnt go away it took me until nearly midnight to understand what it was it was me watching me looming large and smelly sunday i woke up feeling like id been sick with the flu like id had one of those bad convoluted unexplainable fever dreams and what ive figured out about bad convoluted unexplainable dreams of any kind is that youve just got to shake them off try to forget that they ever happened i shook it off all right and got out of bed early cause i had eaten almost nothing the night before and i was starving but as i was trucking into the kitchen i glanced into the family room and noticed that my dad was sacked out on the couch this was not good this was a sign of battles still in progress and it made me feel like an invader in my own territory he rolled over and kind of groaned then curled up tighter under his skinny little quilt and muttered some pretty unfriendlysounding stuff into his pillow i beat it into the kitchen and poured myself a killer bowl of corn flakes and i was about to drown it in milk when my mother comes waltzing in and snags it away from me you are going to wait young man she says this family is going to have sunday breakfast together but im starving so are the rest of us now go im making pancakes and youre taking a shower go like a showers going to prevent imminent starvation but i headed down to the bathroom and on my way
Document 33
i noticed that the family room was empty the quilt was folded and back on the armrest the pillow was goneit was like id imagined the whole thing at breakfast my father didnt look like hed spent the night on the couch no bags under his eyes no whiskers on his chin he was decked out in tennis shorts and a lavender polo shirt and his hair was all blown dry like it was a workday personally i thought the shirt looked kind of girly but my mom said you look very nice this morning rick my father just eyed her suspiciously then my grandfather came in saying patsy the house smells wonderful good morning rick hi there bryce and winked at me as he sat down and put his napkin in his lap lynetta my mother sang out breakfast my sister appeared in a triplex miniskirt and platform shoes with eyes that were definitely of the raccoon variety my mother gasped but then took a deep breath and said good morning honey youre youre i thought you were going to church this morning with your friends i am lynetta scowled and sat down mom brought pancakes fried eggs and hash browns to the table my father just sat there stiff as a board for a minute but finally he shook out his napkin and tucked it into his collar well my mother said as she sat down i have come up with a solution to our situation here it comes my father muttered but my mother gave him a glare that shut him down cold the solution is my mom said as she served herself some pancakes were going to invite the bakers over for dinner my father blurts out what lynetta asks all of them i put in are you serious but my grandfather heaps on another fried egg and says that patsy is a marvelous idea thanks dad she says with a smile then tells lynetta and me of course im serious and yes if juli and the boys want to come theyll be invited my sister starts cracking up do you know what youre saying mom smooths the napkin into her lap maybe its about time i found out lynetta turns to me and says shes inviting the core of piss poor over for dinner oh this is something i really woke up expecting my father shakes his head and says patsy what purpose does this serve so i made some stupid cracks last night is this the next phase in my punishment it is something we should have done years ago patsy please i know you feel bad about what you found out but an awkward dinner party isnt going to change anything my mother ran syrup all over her pancakes popped the top closed licked her finger then locked eyes with my dad we are having the bakers over for dinner and that she didnt have to tell him was that dad took a deep breath then sighed and said whatever you want patsy just dont say i didnt warn you he took a bite of hash browns and mumbled a barbecue i suppose no rick a sitdown dinner like we have when your clients come over he stopped chewing youre expecting them to dress up mom glared at him what im expecting is for you to behave like the gentleman i always thought you were dad went back to his potatoes definitely safer than arguing with mom lynetta wound up eating the entire white of a fried egg and almost a whole pancake besides plain of course but from the way she was glutting and giggling as she ate it was obvious that at least she was in a good mood granddad ate plenty even for him but i couldnt tell what he was thinking he was back to looking more granite than human me id started tuning in to the fact that this dinner could be more than awkward it could be trouble those rotten eggs were back from the grave looming large and smelly right over my head sure granddad knew but no one else in my family did what if it came up at dinner id be dead fried cluckfaced meat later as i was brushing my teeth i considered bribing juli getting her on board so that nobody brought up the subject of eggs or maybe i could sabotage the dinner somehow make it not happen yeah i could i stopped myself and looked in the mirror what kind of wimp was i anyway i spit and headed back to find my mom what is it honey she asked me as she wiped off the griddle you look worried i doublechecked to make sure my dad or lynetta wasnt lurking around somewhere then whispered will you swear to secrecy she laughed i dont know about that i just waited what can be she said then looked at me and stopped cleaning oh it is serious honey whats wrong it had been ages since id voluntarily fessed up about something to my mom it just didnt seem necessary anymore id learned to deal with things on my own at least thats what id thought until now she touched my arm and said bryce tell me what is it i hopped up to sit on the counter then took a deep breath and said its about julis eggs about her eggs yeah remember that whole chickenhensalmonella disaster that was quite a while ago but sure well what you dont know is that juli didnt bring eggs over just that once shes been bringing them over every weekor about that anyway she has why didnt i know about this well i was afraid dad would get mad at me for not telling her we didnt want them so i started intercepting them id see her coming get to her before she rang the bell and then id toss them in the trash
Document 34
before anyone knew shed been here oh bryce well i kept thinking theyd stop how long can a stupid chicken lay eggs but i take it they have stopped yeah as of last week because juli caught me chucking a carton in the trash outside oh dear exactly so what did you tell her i looked down and mumbled i told her that we were afraid of salmonella poisoning because their yard was such a mess she ran off crying and the next thing i know shes starting to fix up their yard oh bryce exactly she was dead quiet for a minute then very softly she said thank you for your honesty bryce it does help to explain a lot she shook her head and said what that family must think of us and got back to cleaning the griddle all the more reason to have them over for dinner if you ask me i whispered youre sworn to secrecy on this whole egg thing right i mean juli told granddad so he knows but i dont want this to spread to you know dad she studied me a minute then said tell me youve learned your lesson honey i have mom okay then i let out a big sigh of relief thanks oh and bryce yeah im very glad you told me about it she kissed me on the cheek then smiled and said now didnt i hear you promise youd mow the lawn today right i said and headed outside to trim the turf that evening my mother announced that the bakers would be over friday night at six oclock that the menu included poached salmon crab risotto and fresh steamed vegetables and that none of us had better weasel out of being there my dad muttered that if we were really going to do this it would be a whole lot better to barbecue because at least that way hed have something to do but my mom positively smoked him with her eyes and he dropped it so they were coming and it made seeing juli at school even more uncomfortable than usual not because she gushed about it or even waved and winked or something no she was back to avoiding me shed say hi if we happened to run into each other but instead of being like right over my shoulder anytime i looked she was nowhere she must have ducked out back doors and taken roundabout ways through campus she was i dont know scarce i found myself looking at her in class the teacherd be talking and all eyes would be up front except mine they kept wandering over to juli it was weird one minute id be listening to the teacher and the next id be completely tuned out looking at juli it wasnt until wednesday in math that i figured it out with the way her hair fell back over her shoulders and her head was tilted she looked like the picture in the paper not just like it the angle was different and the wind wasnt blowing through her hair but she did look like the picture a lot like the picture making that connection sent a chill down my spine and i wondered what was she thinking could she really be that interested in root derivations darla tressler caught me watching and man she gave me the worlds wickedest smile if i didnt do something fast this was going to spread like wildfire so i squinted at her and whispered theres a bee in her hair stupid then pointed around in the air like there it goes see darlas neck whipped around searching for the bee and i straightened out my focus for the rest of the day the last thing i needed was to be scorched by the likes of darla tressler that night i was doing my homework and just to prove to myself that id been wrong i pulled that newspaper article out of my trash can and as im flipping it over im telling myself its a distortion of reality its my imagination she doesnt really look like that but there she was the girl in my math class two rows over and one seat up glowing through newsprint lynetta barged in i need your sharpener she said i slammed my binder closed over the paper and said youre supposed to knock and then since she was zooming in and the paper was still sticking out i crammed the binder into my backpack as fast as i could what are you trying to hide there baby brother nothing and stop calling me that and dont barge into my room anymore give me your sharpener and im history she said with her hand out i dug it out of my drawer and tossed it at her and sure enough she disappeared but two seconds later my mom was calling for me and after that well i forgot that the paper was in my binder until first period the next morning that is man what was i supposed to do with it i couldnt get up and throw it out garrett was right there besides that darla tresslers in that class and i could tell she was keeping an eye out for wayward bees if she caught wind of this id be the one stung then garrett reaches over to snag a piece of paper like he does about fourteen times a day only i have a complete mental spaz and slam down on his hand with mine dude he says whats your problem sorry i say tuning in to the fact that he was only going for lined paper not newspaper dude he says again you know youve been really spaced lately anyone else tell you that he rips a piece of paper out of my binder then notices the edges of the newspaper he eyes me and before i can stop him he whips

it out i pounce on him and tear it out of his hands but its too late hes seen her picture before he can say a word i get in his face and say you shut up you hear me this is not what you think whoa kick back will ya i wasnt thinking anything but i could see the little gears go clickclickclick in his brain then he smirks at me and says im sure youve got a perfectly reasonable explanation for why youre carrying a picture of juli baker around with you the way he said it scared me like he was playing with the idea of roasting me in front of the whole class i leaned over and said zip it would you the teacher hammered on us to be quiet but it didnt stop garrett from smirking at me or doing the doubleeyebrow wiggle in the direction of my binder after class darla tried to act all cool and preoccupied but she had her radar up and pointed our way she shadowed me practically all day so there was no real window of opportunity to explain things to garrett what was i going to tell him anyway that the paper was in my binder because i was trying to hide it from my sister that would help besides i didnt want to make up some lame lie about it i actually wanted to talk to garrett i mean he was my friend and a lot had happened in the last couple of months that was weighing on me i thought that if i talked to him maybe hed help get me back on track help me to stop thinking about everything garrett was real reliable in that arena luckily in social studies our class got library time to do research for our famous historical figure report darla and juli were both in that class but i managed to drag garrett into a back corner of the library without either of them noticing and the minute we were by ourselves i found myself laying into garrett about chickens he shakes his head at me and says dude what are you talking about remember when we went and looked over her fence back in the sixth grade yeah remember how you were down on me for wondering what a hen was he rolled his eyes not this again man you didnt know jackdiddlysquat about chickens i put my life in your hands and you dumped me in a bucket of bull so i told him about my dad and the eggs and salmonella and how id been intercepting eggs for nearly two years he just shrugged and said makes sense to me man she caught me who juli whoa dude i told him about what id said and how almost right after that she was out playing weed warrior in her front yard well so its not your fault her yards a mess but then i found out that they dont even own that house theyre all poor because her dads got a retarded brother that theyre you know paying for garrett gives me a real chumpy grin and says a retard well that explains a lot doesnt it i couldnt believe my ears what you know he says still grinning about juli my heart started pounding and my hands clenched up and for the first time since id learned to dive away from trouble i wanted to deck somebody but we were in the library and besides it flashed through my mind that if i decked him for what hed said hed turn around and tell everyone that i was hot for juli baker and i was not hot for juli baker so i made myself laugh and say oh right and then came up with an excuse to put some distance between him and me after school garrett asked me to come to his house and hang for a while but i had zero interest in that i still wanted to slug him i tried to talk myself down from feeling that way but in my gut i was flaming mad at the guy hed crossed the line man hed crossed it bigtime and what made the whole thing so stinking hard to ignore was the fact that standing right next to him on the other side of the line was my father the visit sunday mornings are peaceful in our house my father lets himself sleep in my mother lets herself not fix breakfast and if my brothers have been out late playing with their band you wont even know theyre around until noon usually i tiptoe out to collect eggs while everyone else is asleep then spirit a bowl of cheerios back to my room to have breakfast in bed and read but that sundayafter spending most of the night feeling upset or uneasyi woke up wanting to do something physical to shake off the confused way i was still feeling what i really needed was a good climb in my sycamore tree but i settled for watering the lawn while i tried to think of other things i cranked open the spigot and admired how rich and black the dirt looked as i sprinkled back and forth across the soil and i was busy talking to my buried seedlings coaxing them to spring up and greet the rising sun when my father came outside his hair was damp from a shower and he had a grocery sack rolled closed in his hand dad im sorry if i woke you you didnt sweetheart ive been up for a while youre not going to work are you no i he studied me for a moment then said im going to visit david uncle david he walked toward his truck saying thats right i i should be back around noon but dad why today its sunday i know sweetheart but its a special sunday i turned

off the spigot whys that its his fortieth birthday i want to see him and deliver a gift he said as he held up the paper bag dont worry ill rustle us up some pancakes for lunch all right im coming with you i said and tossed the hose aside i wasnt even really dressedid just pulled on some sweats and sneakers no socks but in my mind there was no doubt i was going why dont you stay home and enjoy the morning with your mother im sure she would i went over to the passenger side of his truck and said im coming then climbed inside and slammed the door back in place but he said through the drivers door im coming dad he studied me a moment then said okay and put the bag on the bench seat let me leave a note for your mother while he was inside i strapped on the lap belt and told myself that this was good this was something i shouldve done years ago uncle david was part of the family part of my father part of me it was about time i got to know him i studied the paper sack sitting next to me what was my father bringing his brother for his fortieth birthday i picked it up it wasnt a paintingit was much too light for that plus it made a strange muted rattling noise when i shook it i was just unrolling the top to peek inside when my father came back through the front door i dropped the sack and straightened up and when he slid behind the wheel i said its okay with you isnt it he just looked at me his hand on the key in the ignition i im not ruining your day with him or anything am i he cranked the motor and said no sweetheart im glad youre coming we didnt say much to each other on the drive over to greenhaven he seemed to want to look at the scenery and i well i had a lot of questions but none i wanted to ask it was nice though riding with my father it was like the silence connected us in a way that explanations never could when we arrived at greenhaven my father parked the truck but we didnt get out right away it takes some getting used to julianna but it does grow on you they grow on you theyre all good people i nodded but felt oddly afraid come on then he said taking the sack from the seat lets go inside greenhaven didnt look like any kind of hospital to me but it didnt look quite like a house either it was too long and rectangular for that the walkway had a faded green awning that covered it and flower beds alongside with freshly planted pansies that looked muddied and slightly askew the grass was patchy with three deep holes dug near the building the residents tend the grounds my father said its part of their occupational training program and its therapeutic those holes are the future homes of peach plum and pear fruit trees yes the vote caused quite a commotion among the residents thats right he swung open one of the glass double doors and said come on in it was cool inside and it smelled of pine cleaner and bleach with something vaguely pungent underneath there wasnt a reception desk or waiting area just a large intersection with white walls and narrow wooden benches to the left was a big room with a television and several rows of plastic chairs to the right were open office doors and beside us were two pine armoires one was open with half a dozen gray sweaters hung neatly in a row good morning robert a woman called through one of the office doors good morning josie my father replied she came out to meet us saying davids up and about has been since around six mabel tells me its his birthday today mabel is right again he turned to me and smiled josie its my pleasure to introduce my daughter julianna julianna meet josie gruenmakker well now isnt this nice josie said clasping my hand i recognize you from davids photo album youre gettin ready to graduate into high school isnt that right i blinked at her then looked at my dad id never really thought of it that way but i could see that he had yes i i suppose i am josies the site administrator and josie added with a laugh im not graduatin to nowhere been here seventeen years and im staying put the phone rang and she hurried off saying gotta get that ill meet up with you in a bit check the rec room then his room youll find him my dad led me around a corner and as we proceeded down a hallway the underlying pungent part of the smell got stronger like the place had had years of mystery pissers with no one quite neutralizing what had been tagged down the hall was a small person hunched in a wheelchair at first i thought it was a child but as we approached i could see it was a woman she had almost no hair and as she gave my dad a toothless smile she grabbed his hand and spoke my heart bottomed out the sounds she made were choked and lost on her tongue nothing she said was intelligible yet she looked at my father with such intensitylike of course he understood what she was saying to my complete surprise he said youre absolutely right mabel it is today which is why im here he held up the grocery sack and whispered ive brought him a little gift gwaaaal she said howd you know she gurgled at him until he patted her hand and said im much too predictable im afraid but he enjoys them and he

passion for strawberry milkshakes i managed a smile and whispered nice to meet you but all i got in return was a suspicious scowl well were off to davids my father said then shook the bag dont spill the beans if he happens by i followed him to a bedroom doorway where he stopped and called david david its robert a man appeared at the door a man i would never have picked out as my fathers brother he was stocky with thick brown glasses and his face looked puffy and pale but he threw his arms around my fathers chest and cried wobbad yaw heew yes i am little brother i followed them into the room and saw that the walls were covered in a collage of puzzles theyd been glued directly to the walls and even up on the ceiling it was cozy and comfortable and interesting i felt as though id entered a quilted cave my father held his brother at arms length and said and look who ive brought along for a split second david looked almost frightened but then my father said its my daughter julianna davids face broke into a smile juweeeanna he cried then practically tackled me with a hug i thought i was going to suffocate my face was buried as he squeezed the air out of me and rocked from side to side then with a giggle he let go and flopped into a chair is mooy bwufday i know uncle david happy birthday he giggled again fwank eoow we brought you a present my dad said as he opened the paper sack before he had it out before i saw the actual size i remembered the sound it had made when id shaken it in the truck of course i thought a puzzle uncle david guessed it too a puwwwle not just a puzzle my dad said as he pulled it out of the sack a puzzle and a pinwheel dad had wrapped the puzzle box up in pretty blue paper and had taped the redandyellow pinwheel on as a bow uncle david snatched the pinwheel right off and blew first gently then fiercely in great spitty bursts ownge he cried between blows ownge very gently dad took it from him and smiled red and yellow do make orange dont they david tried to grab it back but my father said well take it outside later the wind will blow it for you and pressed the puzzle back in his hands as the wrapping paper fell in shreds on the floor i leaned in to see what sort of puzzle my father had bought him and gasped three thousand pieces and the image was simply white clouds and blue sky no shading no treesnothing but the clouds and the sky my father pointed to a spot in the center of the ceiling i thought it would fit just right over there uncle david looked up and nodded then lunged for his pinwheel and said owsiiide sure lets go out for a walk feel like going down to mcelliots for a birthday ice cream uncle davids head bobbed up and down yaaah we checked out through josie then headed down the street david cant walk very fast because his body seems to want to move inward instead of forward his feet pigeontoe and his shoulders hunch in and he seemed to lean on my father pretty heavily as we moved along but he kept that pinwheel in front of him watching it spin crying every now and then owwwange owwwange mcelliots turned out to be a drugstore with an ice cream parlor inside there was a redand whitestriped awning over the ice cream counter and there were little white tables and chairs set in an area with redandwhitestriped wallpaper it was very festivelooking especially for being inside a drugstore dad got us all cones and once we were sitting down dad and david did talk to each other some but mostly david wanted to eat his chocolate fudge swirl my father smiled at me from time to time and i smiled back but i felt disconnected how many times had the two of them come here for ice cream how many birthdays had my father celebrated with his brother like this how long had he known mabel and josie and the rest of the people at greenhaven how could it be that in all these years id never spent any time with my uncle it was like my father had a secret life away from me a complete family away from me i didnt like it didnt understand it and i was getting myself pretty worked up about it when davids cone crushed in his grip causing his ice cream to flop onto the table before my dad could stop him david picked up the ice cream and tried to cram it back onto the cone but the cone was shattered and the ice cream fell over again only this time it landed on the floor my dad said leave it david ill get you a new one but david didnt listen his chair shot back and he dove after it no david let me get you a new one my dad pulled him by the arm but david wouldnt budge he grabbed the ice cream and crammed it back onto what was left of his cone and when the bottom part of his cone crumbled completely away he started screaming it was awful he was like a twohundredpound infant throwing a tantrum on the floor he was yelling words i couldnt understand and after a minute of trying to calm him down my father said julianna can you get him another cone the man

behind the counter scooped as fast as he could but in that short time david knocked over a table and two chairs with his flailing and managed to smear chocolate everywhere the checkers and customers at the registers seemed frozen with terrorlike david was some sort of monster out to destroy the world i gave the new cone to my father who handed it to david right there on the floor and while david sat there eating it my father and i worked around him putting everything back in order and wiping up the mess on the walk back to greenhaven david acted like nothing had happened he spurted into his pinwheel and cried owwwange from time to time but when my dad held open the front door i could tell that david was tired down in his room david placed the pinwheel on his bed and picked up the puzzle box why dont you take a rest before you get started on it my dad asked david shook his head naaow okay then let me help you set it up my father pulled a card table from beneath the bed then swung the legs out and snapped them into place after he had it shoved up against the wall near the bed he moved a chair close to it and said there you are all set up david had the box open and was already sifting through the pieces aaaas a gou wwwone wobbad im glad you like it you think you might have it done by wednesday i can come back and glue it on the ceiling for you then if youd like david nodded but he was already intent on the puzzle carefully laying pieces on the table my father put his hand on his shoulder and said ill see you wednesday then okay he nodded will you say goodbye to julianna baaawye he said but he didnt look up from his box of pieces see you later uncle david i tried to sound cheerful but i didnt feel that way when we got back into the truck my dad clicked on his seat belt and said so i just looked at him and tried to smile are you as exhausted as i am he said i nodded everything was fineexcept for the ice cream dad chuckled except for the ice cream then he turned serious the trouble is you never know what the ice cream is going to be sometimes its a fly in the room sometimes its the feel of his socks its hard to predict everything usually getting ice cream is safe he shook his head and closed his eyes thinking things i couldnt imagine finally he turned the ignition and said david lived with your mother and me for a while before you kids were born we thought it would be better for him to live with us than to be in a home but we were wrong but overall everything went okay today he ground the gearshift into reverse david has many many special needs both emotional and physical your mom and i couldnt handle them all fortunately hes happy here they have programs to teach him how to care for himself how to dress and bathe and brush his teeth how to act around others and communicate they go on outings and he has a job doing mailings for a doctors office he does he goes there every morning during the week to fold mailings and fill envelopes greenhavens been so good for him he gets an incredible amount of individualized attention he has his own room his own friends his own life after a minute i said but hes part of the family dad and it just doesnt seem right that hes never been over for a visit not even on christmas or thanksgiving he doesnt want to sweetheart one year your mother and i insisted he spend thanksgiving with us and it was the biggest disaster you can imagine he broke a window out of the car he was that upset but why havent we been visiting him i know you have but the rest of us why not well its draining your mother finds it incredibly depressing and i understand that we both agreed that it was no place to take small children he accelerated onto the highway silent behind the wheel finally he said the years just seem to slip away julianna one day you have a baby in your arms and the next you realize shes very nearly a woman he smiled at me sadly i love david but he is a burden and i guess i wanted to protect you from that but i realize now that all of this has affected you and the family but dad its not julianna what im trying to tell you is im sorry there was so much i wanted to give you all of you i guess i didnt see until recently how little ive actually provided thats not true well i think you know my hearts been in the right place but if you line it up objectively a man like say mr loski adds up to a much better husband and father than a man like me does hes around more he provides more and hes probably a lot more fun my dad wasnt one to go fishing for compliments or signs of appreciation but still i couldnt quite believe he actually thought that dad i dont care how it looks on paper i think youre the best dad ever and when i marry somebody someday i sure dont want him to be like mr loski i want him to be like you he looked at me like he couldnt quite believe his ears is that so he said with a grin well ill remind you of that as your someday approaches that turned the rest of the trip around we laughed and joked and talked
Document 39
about all kinds of things but as we neared home there was one thing the conversation kept turning back to pancakes my mother though had other plans shed spent the morning scrubbing floors and nixed the pancakes i need something with more staying power like grilled hamandcheese with onions she said lots of onions scrubbing floors my dad said its sunday trina why were you scrubbing floors nervous energy she looked at me howd it go okay im glad i went she glanced at my dad and then at me well good she sighed then said i also felt like scrubbing because i got a call from patsy loski my dad asked is something wrong my mother pushed a few wisps of hair back and said no she called to invite us over for dinner on friday we blinked at her a moment then i asked all of us yes i could see what my dad was thinking why all these years of living across the street and wed never been invited over why now my mom could see it too she sighed and said robert i dont exactly know why but she was insistent she was practically in tears saying how sorry she was that shed never invited us before and how shed really like to get to know us better what did you tell her i couldnt very well say no she was being so nice and chet has really done a lot she shrugged and said i said wed go its set for six oclock friday night really i asked she shrugged again i think it might be nice a little strange but nice well okay then my dad said i wont schedule any overtime for friday what about the boys theres no gig on the calendar and theyre not scheduled to work but i havent talked to them about it yet are you sure they want us all over there my dad asked my mom nodded she insists i could tell the whole idea of dinner at the loskis was making my dad pretty uncomfortable but we could both see that something about this invitation meant a lot to my mother all right then he said and got to work slicing cheese and onions for the rest of the afternoon i sort of lazed around reading and daydreaming and at school the next day i couldnt seem to concentrate my thoughts kept turning back to david i wondered what my grandparents had been like and what theyd gone through having a son like him i daydreamed a lot about the sycamore tree too which at first i thought was because i was feeling melancholy but then i remembered how my mother had called the sycamore a testimony to endurance it had survived being damaged as a sapling it had grown other people thought it was ugly but i never had maybe it was all how you looked at it maybe there were things i saw as ugly that other people thought were beautiful like shelly stalls a perfect example to me there was absolutely nothing to recommend her but the rest of the world seemed to think she was the cats meow meow anyway i sort of drifted through the week like that until thursday thursday our social studies class went to the library to do research for our famous historical figure report id chosen susan b anthony and her fight for the right to vote and i was in the middle of tracking down some books when darla tressler flagged me from the end of a stack darla was in a few of my classes but we werent really friends so i looked behind me to see who else she might be flagging come here she mouthed frantically waving me over so i hurried over she pointed through the column of books and whispered listen it was garretts voice and then bryces and they were talking about me about my chickens and salmonella poisoning and how bryce had been throwing away my eggs and about me fixing up our yard bryce was sounding like he felt really bad but then suddenly my blood ran cold he was talking about david and then garrett laughed and said a retard well that explains a lot doesnt it you know about juli for a second there was silence and at that moment i was sure they must be able to hear my heart pounding in my chest but then bryce laughed and said oh right i positively crumbled onto the floor and in a flash the voices were gone darla checked around the corner then sat beside me saying oh jules im so so sorry i thought he was about to confess that hes been crushing on you what darla bryce does not have a crush on me where have you been havent you noticed the way hes been looking at you that boy is lost in loveland oh obviously you just heard him darla yeah but yesterday yesterday i caught him staring at you and he said there was a bee in your hair a bee girl is that the lamest coverup youve ever heard or what darla the way things have been going i wouldnt be surprised if there was a bee in my hair oh you think youre that sweet huh just attract bees like honey well honey the only bee youre attracting around here is bryce cute yeah but after what i just heard id stomp and grind girl stomp and grind she got up to go but turned and said dont worry i wont jabber i just shook my head and forgot about darla how wrong could a person be it was what bryce and garrett had said that i couldnt forget how could they be so cruel and so stupid is this what my father had gone through growing up the more i thought about it the angrier i got what right
Document 40
did bryce have to make fun of my uncle how dare he i felt fire burn in my cheeks and a cold hard knot tighten in my heart and in a flash i knewi was through with bryce loski he could keep his brilliant blue eyes he could keep his twofaced smile and and my kiss thats right he could keep that too i was never ever going to talk to him again i stormed back to the section of books on susan b anthony found two that would work and then went back to my table but as i was collecting my things to check out of the library i remembered the next day we were going to the loskis house for dinner i zipped up my backpack and threw it on my shoulder surely after what had happened i had the right to vote against going didnt i the serious willies realizing that my father had the same sense of humor as garrett gave me the serious willies i had the hardest time just looking at my dad let alone speaking to him but at about five oclock friday afternoon i agreed with him about one thing we shouldve barbecued a barbecue is more you know lowkey instead my mom was flying around the kitchen slicing and dicing and barking orders at dad and me like the president was coming to dinner we swept the floor put an extra leaf in the table brought in five more chairs and set the table we set it all wrong of course but all my mother had to do was shuffle things around to make it right it looked the same to me but what do i know she put out candlesticks and said rick can you load the dishes and run them id like a chance to get cleaned up after that you can change and bryce what are you wearing mom its the bakers are you trying to make them feel totally worthless trina and i agreed on a dressup so but why my dad put a hand on my shoulder and said so we can all feel equally uncomfortable son women i looked at her and said does that mean i have to wear a tie no but some sort of buttondown instead of a tshirt would be nice i went down to my room and ripped through my closet looking for something with buttons there were lots of buttons all right lots of geeky buttons i thought about boycotting my mothers dresscode requirements but instead i started putting on shirts twenty minutes later i still wasnt dressed and i was extremely ticked off about it because what did it matter why did i care what i looked like at this stupid dinner i was acting like a girl then through a gap in my curtains i saw them coming out their front door down their walkway across the street it was like a weird dream they seemed to be floating toward our house all five of them i pulled a shirt off my bed punched my arms in and buttoned up two seconds later the doorbell rang and mom called can you get that bryce luckily granddad beat me to it he greeted them all like they were longlost family and even seemed to know which one was matt and which one was mike one was wearing a purple shirt and the other was wearing a green one so it shouldnt have been that hard to remember which was which but they came in and pinched my cheeks and said hey baby brother hows it goin and i got so mad i mixed them up again my mother zoomed in from the kitchen saying come in come in its so nice you all could make it she called lynetta rick weve got compa ny but then stopped short when she saw juli and mrs baker well whats this she asked homemade pies mrs baker said blackberry cheesecake and pecan they look wonderful absolutely wonderful my mother was acting so hyper i couldnt believe it she took julis pie then whooshed a path to the kitchen with mrs baker lynetta appeared from around the corner which made matt and mike grin and say hey lyn lookin good black skirt black nails black eyes for a nocturnal rodent yeah i suppose she was looking good they disappeared down to lynettas room and when i turned around my granddad was taking mr baker into the front room which left me in the entry hall with juli alone she wasnt looking at me she seemed to be looking at everything but me and i felt like an idiot standing there in my geeky buttondown shirt with pinched cheeks and nothing to say and i got so nervous about having nothing to say that my heart started going wacko on me hammering like it does right before a race or a game or something on top of that she looked more like that stupid picture in the paper than the picture did if that makes any sense not because she was all dressed up she wasnt she was wearing some normallooking dress and normallooking shoes and her hair was the way it always is except maybe a little more brushed out it was the way she was looking at everything but me with her shoulders back and her chin out and her eyes flashing we probably only stood there for five seconds but it felt like a year finally i said hi juli her eyes flashed at me and thats when it sank in she was mad she whispered i heard you and garrett making fun of my uncle in the library and i dont want to speak to you you understand me not now not ever my mind was racing where had she been i hadnt seen her anywhere near me in the library and had she heard it or had
Document 41
she heard it from somebody else i tried to tell her it wasnt me that it was garrett all garrett but she shut me down and made tracks for the front room to be with her dad so im standing there wishing id punched garrett out in the library so juli wouldnt stick me in the same class as someone who makes retard jokes when my dad shows up and claps me on the shoulder so hows the party son speak of the devil i wanted to whack his hand off my shoulder he leans out so he can see into the front room and says hey the dad cleans up pretty good doesnt he i shrug away from him mr bakers name is robert dad yeah you know i knew that he rubs his hands together and says i guess i ought to go in and say hello coming nah mom probably needs my help i didnt run off to the kitchen though i stood there and watched mr baker shake my fathers hand and as they stood there pumping and smiling this weird feeling started coming over me again not about juli about my father standing next to mr baker he looked small physically small and compared to the cut of mr bakers jaw my dads face looked kind of weaselly this is not the way you want to feel about your father when i was little id always thought that my dad was right about everything and that there wasnt a man on earth he couldnt take but standing there looking in i realized that mr baker could squash him like a bug worse though was the way he was acting watching my dad chum it up with julis dadit was like seeing him lie to mr baker to juli to my grandfatherto everybody why was he being such a worm why couldnt he just act normal you know civil why did he have to put on such a phony show this went way beyond keeping the peace with my mother this was disgusting and people said i was the spitting image of my father how often had i heard that one id never thought about it much but now it was turning my stomach mom jingled the dinner bell and called hors doeuvres are ready and then saw me still standing in the hallway bryce whered your sister and the boys go i shrugged down to her room i think go tell them would you and then come have some hors doeuvres sure i said anything to get rid of the taste in my mouth lynettas door was closed and normally i would have knocked and called mom wants you or dinner or something but in that split second before my knuckles hit wood my hand became possessed by evil baby brother i turned the knob and walked right in does lynetta freak out or throw stuff at me and scream for me to get out no she ignores me mattandmike give me a nod and lynetta sees me but shes got her hands over some headphones and her whole bodys bobbing up and down as she listens to a portable cd player mattormike whispers its about over well be right there like of course i was there to say it was time to eat what else would i be doing there something about that made me feel i dont know left out i wasnt even a person to those guys i was just baby brother nothing new there but now it really bugged me like all of a sudden i didnt fit in anywhere not at school not at home and every time i turned around another person id known forever felt like a stranger to me even i felt like a stranger to me standing around eating little round crackers smeared with whipped cheese and fish eggs didnt do much for my mood either my mother was acting like an entire swarm of busy bees she was everywhere in the kitchen out of the kitchen serving drinks handing out napkins explaining the food but not eating a thing lynetta didnt buy moms explanation on the hors doeuvres she wound up dissecting hers categorizing the parts into gross disgusting and hanging near her didnt stop the baker boys from shoving crackers in whole though man i was just waiting for them to wrap themselves around a table leg and flex juli her dad and my grandfather were off to the side talking nonstop about something and my dad was over with mrs baker looking about as stupid as i felt standing by myself talking to no one my mom flutters over to me and says you doing okay honey yeah i tell her but she forces me over to where granddad is anyway go on go on she whispers dinner will be ready in a minute so i stand there and the group of them opens up but its more like a reflex than anything no one says a word to me they just keep right on talking about perpetual motion perpetual motion my friend i didnt even know what perpetual motion was they were talking closed systems open systems resistance energy source magnetism it was like joining a discussion in a different language and juli juli was saying stuff like well what if you put the magnets back to back reversed the polarity like she really understood what they were talking about then my granddad and her dad would explain why her idea wouldnt work but all that did was make juli ask another question i was completely lost and even though i was pretending to follow along with what they were saying what i was really doing was trying not to stare at juli when my mom called us for dinner i did my best to pull juli aside and apologize to her but she gave me the cold shoulder and who could
Document 42
blame her really i sat down across from her feeling pretty low why hadnt i said something to garrett in the library i didnt have to punch him why hadnt i just told him he was out of line after mom served everyone their food dad seemed to decide that he ought to be the one directing the conversation so mike and matt he says youre seniors this year amen they say together amen as in youre glad high schools over absolutely my father starts twirling his fork whys that matt and mike look at each other then back at my dad the regurgitation gets to you after a while isnt that funny he says looking around the table high school was probably the best time of my life mattormike says seriously dude its totally lame mrs baker shoots him a look but that doesnt stop him well it is mom its that whole robotron attitude of education confine confute conformive had totally enough of that scene my dad eyes my mom with a little itoldyouso grin then says to matt and mike so i take it college is out of the question god what was with him in a flash i was clutching my fork and knife ready to duke it out for a couple of guys who pinched my cheeks and called me baby brother i took a deep breath and tried to relax tried to dive down to calmer water this wasnt my fight besides matt and mike seemed cool with it oh no they said college is a total possibility yeah we got accepted a couple of places but were going to give the music thing a shot first oh the music thing my father says matt and mike look at each other then shrug and get back to eating but lynetta glares at him and says your sarcasm is not appreciated dad lyn lyn says mattormike its cool everyones like that about it its a showmedont tellme thing thats a great idea lynetta says jumping out of her seat and dashing down the hall mom freezes not sure what to do about lynetta but then mrs baker says dinner is absolutely delicious patsy thanks trina its its nice to have all of you over theres about three seconds of quiet and then lynetta comes in and jabs at the cd player buttons until the drawer slides back in lyn no not a good idea says mattormike yeah lyn its not exactly dinner music tough says lynetta and cranks the volume boom whack boomboom whack the candles practically shake in their holders then guitars rip through the air and about blow them out matt and mike look up at the speakers then grin at each other and call over to my dad surround sound awesome setup mr loski all the adults were dying to jump up and turn the thing down but lynetta stood guard and just glowered at them and when the songs over lynetta pulls out the cd punches off the player and then smiles actually smiles at matt and mike and says that is the raddest song i want to hear it again and again and again mattormike says to my dad you probably dont like it but its what we do you boys wrote that song uhhuh he motions lynetta to pass the cd over saying just the one song mattormike laughs and says dude weve got a thousand songs but theres only three on the demo dad holds up the cd this is the demo yeah he looks at it a minute and says so if youre piss poor how do you afford to press cds dad lynetta snaps at him its okay lyn just a joke right mr loski my dad laughs a little and says right but then adds although i am a little curious this is obviously not a homedone demo and i happen to know studio times costprohibitive for most bands matt and mike interrupt him with a slamming hard high five and while im getting uptight about my dad asking them questions about money of all things my moms fumbling all over herself trying to sweep away my dads big pawprints when rick and i met he was playing in a band poached salmon was suddenly swimming down the wrong hatch and while im choking lynettas bugging out her raccoon eyes gasping you played in a band what did you play clarinet no honey my mom says trying to hold it all together your father played guitar guitar cool mattormike says rock country jazz country my dad says which is nothing to scoff at boys dude we know total respect man and when our band looked into getting a demo made it was astronomically expensive that was in a big city where there was a little competition getting a demo made around here i didnt even know there was a facility matt and mike are still grinning theres not so whered you go and howd you afford it my mother whacks him under the table again so he says im just curious patsy matt and mike lean in we did it ourselves this right here you did this yourselves thats impossible hes looking almost mad about it howd you get the gear my mom kicks him again but dad turns on her and says stop it would you im just curious mattormike says its cool mrs loski he smiles at my dad and says we kept cruising the internet and the trades looking for a deal everyones blowing out their old analog gear for digital because thats the move everyone else has made digital if you want to know our opinion is weak you lose too much of the waveform theres not enough fat to it and obviously we like it beefy my granddad puts up a finger and says but a cds digital so exactly but that is the last and only step well compromise
Document 43
on its just a necessity of being part of the industry everyone wants cds but the multitrack and the mixdown to twotrack is analog and we could afford it mr loski because we got used gear and weve been saving up our pennies since we were twelve years old he grins and says you still play we could you know lay down some of your tunes if you want my dad looks down and for a second i couldnt tell if he was going to get mad or cry then he sort of snorts and says thanks but thats not me anymore which was probably the only honest thing my dad said all night after that he was quiet hed try to plaster up a smile now and then but man underneath it he was broody and i was feeling kind of bad for him was he thinking about the good old days playing in a band i tried picturing him in cowboy boots and a cowboy hat with a guitar strapped across his shoulder playing some old willie nelson song he was right it just wasnt him but the fact that it ever had been made me feel even more like a stranger in a strange land then when the night was over and the bakers were piling out the front door something else strange happened juli touched my arm and for the first time that night she was looking at me it was that look too channeled directly and solely at me she says im sorry i was so angry when we first came in everyone had a good time and i think your moms really nice for inviting us her voice was quiet almost a whisper i just stood there like a moron staring at her bryce she says touching my arm again did you hear me im sorry i managed a nod but my arm was tingling and my heart was pounding and i felt myself pulling toward her then she was gone out the door and into the night part of a chorus of happy goodbyes i tried to catch my breath what was that what was wrong with me my mother closed the door and said there now what did i tell you that is one delightful family those boys are nothing like i expected lynetta why didnt you tell me they were soso charming theyre drug dealers is what they are everyone turned to my father and dropped their jaws what my mother said there is no other way those boys could afford to buy recording gear like that he glared at lynetta isnt that so lynettas eyes looked like they were going to pop right out of her head rick please my mother said you cant just make accusations like that its the only thing that makes sense patsy believe me i know how musicians are there is no other explanation for this lynetta shouted i happen to know for a fact that they dont use or deal where do you get off saying something like that you are such a twofaced condescending narrowminded jackass there was a split second of silence and then he slapped her smack right across the cheek that put my mother in his face like id never seen and sent my sister screaming insults over her shoulder as she ran down to her room my heart was pounding lynetta was right and i almost almost got in his face too and told him so but then my granddad pulled me aside and we both retreated to our own little corners of the house pacing around my room i had the urge to go talk to lynetta to tell her that she was right that dad was way out of line but i could hear her through the walls crying and screaming while my mom tried to calm her down then she stormed out of the house to whoknowswhere and my mom took up with my dad again so i stayed put and even though the earth quit quaking around eleven oclock there were tremors out there i could feel them as i lay in my bed staring out the window at the sky i thought about how my dad had always looked down on the bakers how hed put down their house and their yard and their cars and what they did for a living how hed called them trash and made fun of mr bakers paintings and now i was seeing that there was something really cool about that family all of them they were justreal and who were we there was something spinning wickedly out of control inside this house it was like seeing inside the bakers world had opened up windows into our own and the view was not a pretty one where had all this stuff come from and why hadnt i ever seen it before the dinner by the time i got home i knew it would be selfish of me to boycott the loskis dinner party my mother had already spent a lot of time humming over pie recipes and going through her closet for something suitable to wear shed even bought a new shirt for dad and had scrutinized what the boys intended to wear obviously she was looking forward to the dinner not that i really understood that but i didnt want to ruin everything by telling her about my newfound hatred of bryce and dad felt bad enough about david already the last thing he needed was to hear about crackpot comments made by immature eighth graders so that night i went through the motions of baking pies with my mother and convinced myself that i was doing the right thing one dinner couldnt change anyones life i just had to get through it friday at school i avoided the blueeyed brat the best i could but that night as i got dressed i found myself staring at
Document 44
the painting my father had given me and became furious all over again bryce had never been a friend to me ever he hadnt made a stand for the tree hed thrown away my eggs and hed made fun of me at my uncles expense why was i playing along like we were jolly friends and neighbors when my mother called that it was time to go i went out in the hall with every intention of telling her that i would not could not go to the loskis for dinner but she looked so lovely and happy that i couldnt i just couldnt i took a deep breath wrapped up a pie and shuffled across the street behind my brothers and parents chet answered the door maybe i shouldve been mad at him too for telling the loskis about my uncle but i wasnt i hadnt asked him not to tell and he certainly wasnt the one making fun of david mrs loski came up behind chet whisked us in and fluttered about and even though she had quite a bit of makeup on i was surprised to see the blueness of bags beneath her eyes then mrs loski and my mother went off with the pies my brothers vanished down the hall with lynetta and my father followed chet into the living room and wasnt that just dandy that left me alone in the foyer with bryce he said hi to me and i lost it i spun on him snapping dont you speak to me i overheard you and garrett in the library and i dont want to talk to you now or ever i started to walk into the living room but he stopped me juli juli wait he whispered im not the bad guy here that was garrett that was all garrett i glared at him i know what i heard no no you dont i i was feeling bad about you know the eggs and what id said about your yard i didnt know anything about your uncle or what kind of situation your family was in okay i just wanted to talk to someone about it our eyes locked for a minute and for the first time the blueness of his didnt freeze up my brain i heard you laugh he made a joke about me being a retard and you laughed juli you dont understand i wanted to punch him really i did but we were in the library so instead you laughed he shrugged and looked miserable and sheepish yeah i left him just walked into the living room and left him if he was making it up he was quite an actor if he was telling the truth then chet was right he was a coward either way i didnt want to be anywhere near him i stood beside my father and tried to follow his discussion with chet about something theyd both read in the paper my father was saying but what hes proposing would require a perpetualmotion machine so its not possible chet replied maybe in the context of what scientists know now but do you rule it out completely at that moment i was feeling absolutely no scientific curiosity but in a desperate attempt to block bryce loski from my mind i asked whats a perpetualmotion machine my father and chet glanced at each other chuckled then shrugged giving me the sense that theyd just agreed to let me into a secret club my father explained its a machine that runs without any external power source no electricity no fuel no water propulsion nothing chet glanced over my shoulder and asked rather absently you think thats a doable thing what had distracted him was bryce still in the foyer why didnt he just go away i forced myself to focus on the conversation do i think thats a doable thing well i dont really know all machines use energy right even real efficient ones and that energy has to come from somewhere what if the machine generated it itself chet asked but one eye was still on the foyer how could it do that neither of them answered me instead my father stuck out his hand and said good evening rick nice of you to have us over mr loski pumped my dads hand and joined our group making little comments about the weather when that topic was all dried up he said and wow that yard of yours has really come along i told chet here that we ought to hire him out he really knows his pickets doesnt he he was joking i think but my father didnt take it that way and neither did chet i was afraid of what might happen next but then mrs loski tinkled a little dinner bell and called hors doeuvres everybody the hors doeuvres were delicious but when my father whispered that the teenytiny black berries on top of the crackers werent berries at all but caviar i stopped midbite fish eggs repulsive then my father pointed out that i ate chicken eggs all the time so why get squeamish over fish eggs he had a point i hesitantly finished the cracker and before long i was having another bryce was standing all by himself across the room and every time i happened to look his way he was staring at me finally i completely turned my back on him and said to my father so whos trying to invent a perpetualmotion machine anyway my father laughed mad scientists all over the world really yes for hundreds of years well what do they do whats one look like it wasnt long before chet was in on the discussion and just as i was finally starting to catch on to magnetism gyroscopic particles and zeropoint energy i felt someone standing behind me it was bryce i could feel my cheeks flush with anger couldnt he see i wanted to
Document 45
be left alone i took a step away from him but what that did was open up the group and allow him to move forward now he was standing in our circle listening to our discussion well surely he was not interested in perpetual motion i barely was myself so i reasoned continuing our discussion would drive him away i dove back in and when the conversation started to peter out i came up with my own ideas on perpetualmotion machines i was like a perpetualidea machine spinning ridiculous suggestions right out of the air and still he wouldnt leave he didnt say anything he just stood there listening then when mrs loski announced that dinner was ready bryce held my arm and whispered juli im sorry ive never been so sorry about anything in my whole life youre right i was a jerk and im sorry i yanked my arm free from his grasp and said it seems to me youve been sorry about a whole lot of things lately and left him there with his apology hanging wounded in the air it didnt take me long to realize that id made a mistake i should have let him say he was sorry and then simply continued to ignore him but id snapped at him in the middle of an apology which somehow made me the rude one i sneaked a peek at him across the table but he was watching his dad who was asking my brothers about graduating and their plans for college i had of course seen mr loski many times but usually from a distance still it seemed impossible that id never noticed his eyes before they were blue brilliant blue and although mr loskis were set farther back and were hidden somewhat by his eyebrows and cheekbones there was no mistaking where bryce had gotten his eyes his hair was black too like bryces and his teeth were white and straight even though chet had called bryce the spitting image of his father id never really thought of them as looking alike but now i saw that they did look alike though where his dad seemed kind of smug bryce seemed well right now he seemed angry then from the other side of the table i heard your sarcasm is not appreciated dad mrs loski gave a small gasp and everyone looked at lynetta well its not she said in all the years weve lived across the street from the loskis ive said about ten words to lynetta and shes said fewer back to me shes scary so it wasnt a surprise to see her glaring at her father but it was uncomfortable mrs loski was keeping a smile perched on her face but she was blinking a lot glancing nervously around the table i looked from one person to the next too wondering if dinner at the loskis was always this tense suddenly lynetta got up and dashed down the hall but she was back in a flash with a cd in her hand and when she put it in the player i recognized one of my brothers songs blaring through the speakers wed heard this song candle ice pouring out of my brothers bedroom at least a million times so we were used to it but i looked over at my mom worried that she might be embarrassed by the distorting guitars and the gritty lyrics this was definitely not caviar music she seemed a little uncertain but in a happy way she was sharing secret smiles with my father and honestly i think she even giggled my dad was looking amused although he was very reserved about it and it took me until the end of the song to realize that he was proud proud that this noise came from his boys that surprised me dad has never been real big on any rendition of my brothers band although hes never really criticized it either but then mr loski started grilling matt and mike about how theyd afforded to record their own music and they explained about working and saving and shopping for good deals on equipment and thats when i realized why my father was proud my brothers were feeling pretty good too you could tell and it was no wonder with the way lynetta was carrying on about how great candle ice was she was positively gushing which seemed very odd coming from lynetta as i looked around it struck me that we were having dinner with a group of strangers wed lived across the street for years but i didnt know these people at all lynetta did know how to smile mr loski was clean and smooth on the outside but there was a distinct whiff of something rotten buried just beneath the surface and the everefficient mrs loski seemed flustered almost hyper was it having us over that was making her nervous then there was brycethe most disturbing of all because i had to admit that i didnt really know him either and based on what id discovered lately i didnt care to know any more looking across the table at him all i got was a strange detached neutral feeling no fireworks no leftover anger or resurging flutters nothing after wed had dessert and it was time to go i went up to bryce and told him i was sorry for having been so fierce when wed first come in i shouldve let you apologize and really it was very nice of your family to have us over i know it was a lot of work and well i think my mom had a really good time and thats what matters to me we were looking right at each other but it was almost as though he didnt hear me bryce i said im sorry he nodded and then our families were waving goodbye and saying good night i walked behind my mother who was holding
Document 46
hands with my father and beside my brothers who were carrying home what was left of our pies we all wound up in the kitchen and matt poured himself a glass of milk and said to mike that mr loski was sniffing us out pretty good tonight wasnt he no kidding maybe he thinks were hot for his daughter not me dude you mike got himself a glass of milk too thats skylers gig no way id go there he grinned but she was really cool tonight did she come down on papa bear or what my dad took a paper plate out of the cupboard and cut a slice of pie you boys showed a lot of restraint tonight i dont know if i couldve kept my cool that way aw hes just you know entrenched matt said gotta adjust to the perspective and deal from there then he added not that id want him as my dad mike practically sprayed his milk dude can you imagine then matt gave my dad a slap on the back and said no way im sticking with my main man here my mom grinned from across the kitchen and said me too id never seen my father cry and he didnt exactly sit there bawling but there were definitely tears welling up in his eyes he blinked them back the best he could and said dont you boys want some pie to go with that milk dude said matt as he straddled a chair i was just thinking that yeah mike added im starved get me a plate too i called as mike dug through the cupboard but we just ate my mother cried come on trina have some pie its delicious i went to bed that night feeling very full and very happy and as i lay there in the dark i wondered at how much emotion can go into any given day and thought how nice it was to feel this way at the end of it and as i nestled in and drifted off to sleep my heart felt wonderfully free the next morning i still felt good i went outside and sprinkled the yard enjoying the splish and patter of water on soil wondering when when that first little blade of grass would spring up into the sunshine then i went out back cleaned the coop raked the yard and dug up some of the bigger weeds growing along the edges mrs stueby leaned over the side fence as i was shoveling my rakings and weeds into a trash can and said hows it going julianna making neat for a rooster a rooster why certainly those hens need some motivation to start laying more it was true bonnie and clydette and the others were only laying about half the eggs that they used to but a rooster i dont think the neighborhood would appreciate my getting a rooster mrs stueby besides wed get chicks and i dont think we can handle any more poultry back here nonsense youve spoiled these birds giving them the whole yard they can share the space easily how else are you going to maintain your business soon those birds wont be laying anything atall they wont well very little i shook my head then said they were just my chicks that grew into chickens and started laying eggs i never really thought of it as a business well my runnin a tab has probably contributed to that and im sorry ill be sure and get you the whole sum this week but consider buying yourself a rooster with some of it ive got a friend down on newcomb street who is positively green over my deviled eggs i gave her my recipe but she says hers just dont taste the same she winked at me im certain shed pay handsomely for a supply of my secret ingredient if it became available she turned to go then said bytheby julianna you have done a mighty fine job on that front yard most impressive thanks mrs stueby i called as she slid open her patio door thanks very much i finished scooping up the piles id made and thought about what mrs stueby had said should i really get a rooster id heard that having one around made chickens lay more whether they were in contact with each other or not i could even breed my chickens and get a whole new set of layers but did i really want to go through all of that again not really i didnt want to be the neighborhood rancher if my girls quit laying altogether that would be just fine with me i put away the rake and shovel clucked a kiss on each of the hens and went inside it felt good to take charge of my own destiny i felt strong and right and certain little did i know how a few days back at school would change all of that flipped after the dinner juli was nice to me at school which i hated mad was better than nice gaga was better than nice it was like i was a stranger to her and man it bugged me bugged me bigtime then the auction happened and i found myself with even bigger problems the auction is this bogus way the booster club raises money for the school they insist its an honor to be chosen but bullstinkinloney to that bottom line is twenty guys get shanghaied they have to come up with fancy picnic lunches and then be humiliated in front of the whole school while girls bid to have lunch with them guess who made this years top twenty youd think mothers would say hey theres no way youre going to auction my son off to the highest bidder but no instead theyre all flattered that their sons been elected a basket boy yes my friend thats what they call you over the
Document 47
pa you hear stuff like there will be an organizational meeting of the newly elected basket boys in the mpr at lunch today all basket boys must attend pretty soon youve completely lost your name you and nineteen other saps are known simply as basket boy my mom of course was into it coming up with all sorts of stuff to put in my basket so id get the highest bid i tried to explain that i didnt want to be in mayfield junior highs basket boy hall of fame and that really what was in the basket didnt matter it wasnt like girls were bidding on the basket when you got right down to it this was a meat market you eat lunch on campus and thats the end of it it is hardly a meat market bryce its an honor besides maybe someone really nice will bid on you and youll make a new friend mothers can be in such denial and then garrett bends my ear with the news that shelly stalls is breaking up with mitch michaelson and that she miranda humes and jenny atkinson are starting some bidding war over me dude he tells me the two hottest chicks on campus and i swear to god man shellys dumped mitch because of you i heard it direct from shagreer and dude shagreer the ear knows all he throws me this nasty grin and says me im rooting for jumbo jenny it would serve you right for being such a basket boy i told him to shut up but he was right with the way my luck was running id probably get stuck with jumbo jenny i could just see it six feet of beefy babe downing both halves of my lunch and then coming after me jennys the only girl or guy on campus who can dunk a basketball the whole gym shakes when she lands and since shes got no you know female parabolas the girl could shave her head and make it in the nba seriously no one would ever suspect her parents give her anything she wants too rumor has it they converted their garage into a fullon basketball court just for her which meant that in the game of the basket boys i was as good as slamdunked unless unless shelly or miranda was high bidder but how could i make sure that happened my brain went into overdrive constructing a plan and in the end i decided that there was only one sensible course of action kiss up to both of them halfway through my first day of doing this i felt like a skunk not that i was being gross about it or anything i was just you know friendly and even though shelly and miranda didnt seem to smell a thing garrett did dude he says to me on thursday i can see your game man what are you talking about dont deny it dude youre working them both he comes up and whispers in my ear basket boy or not im in awe shut up man seriously the ear says they were like clawing each other in pe today i had to know what about jumbo jenny he shrugs havent heard but well find out tomorrow wont we dude my mother dropped me off at school on friday with my stupid oversized picnic basket and since all basket boys have to dress up i was choking in a tie and feeling completely dweeblike in slacks and dress shoes kids whistled and shouted oooh baby as i headed up the walkway and then jumbo jenny passed me taking the front steps three at a time wow bryce she said over her shoulder you look delicious oh man i practically ran to the classroom where all the basket boys were supposed to meet and the minute i walked in i felt better i was surrounded by other dweebs who seemed genuinely happy to see me hey loski yo dude doesnt this suck eggs why didnt you take the bus man misery loves company then mrs mcclure the president of the boosters the lady who lassoed us all hoofs it through the door oh my she says you all look so handsome not one word about our baskets not one little sneak peek inside no for all she cared those puppies were empty meat market you better believe it dont be so nervous boys mrs mcclure was saying youre going to have a wonderful day she pulls out a list of names and starts ordering us into line we get numbers our baskets get numbers we fill out threebyfive cards to her insane specifications and by the time shes got us all organized and is sure we know what to do and what not to do weve missed all of first and most of second period okay gentlemen she says leave your baskets where they are and go to where are we now still in second she looks at the clock right second what about passes some sensible basket boy asked your teachers have a list but if they say anything tell them i say your neckties are your passes ill meet you back here when everyones dismissed for the auction got it dont dawdle we grumbled yeah yeah and headed to class and i can tell you this not one of the twenty of us listened to a word any of our teachers said that morning how can you listen with a noose around your neck pinched toes and a room full of idiots thinking its open season on basket boys whoever started this stupid tradition ought to be crammed into a basket and tossed downstream without a serving spoon i was basket boy number nine which meant i had to stand there on the stage in the gym while nearly half the guys got auctioned off minimum bid ten bucks and if nobody bid the secret was a
Document 48
teacher was assigned to bid on you yes my friend the possibilities for mortification were infinite some of the moms showed up and stood off to the side with their camcorders and zoom lenses fidgeting and waving and basically acting as dweeby as their sons looked i should know my mom took an hour off work to be one of them tim pello was basket boy number five and his mom actually bid on him no kidding she jumped up and down yelling twenty ill give you twenty man thatll brand you for life lucky for tim kelly trott came up with twentytwo fifty and saved his sorry self from everlasting torture as a mamas boy one of the few fates worse than basket boy caleb hughes was up next and he fetched the boosters all of eleven fifty then came chad ormonde who i swear was ready to pee his pants when mrs mcclure made him step forward she read his card pinched his cheeks and raked in fifteen even at this point what stood between me and the auction block was jon trulock and i wasnt exactly interested in what he had in his basket or what his hobbies and favorite sports were i was too busy scanning the crowd for jumbo jenny sweating my pits off mrs mcclure calls into the microphone do i hear ten and it took me a minute to tune in to the fact that no one said ten no one said anything come on out there the lunch is delicious strawberry tarts um and mrs mcclure goes back to reading off the threebyfive about jon trulocks lunch talk about embarrassing this was worse than being a mamas boy worse than lunch with jumbo jenny howd he get voted basket boy if nobody wanted to have lunch with him then off to the right of the crowd i hear ten ten did i hear ten mrs mcclure says with a fluttery smile twelve came a different voice from the same area the first voice came back with fifteen and all of a sudden i recognized whose voice it was juli bakers i searched through the crowd and found her hand waving in the air that look all over her face sixteen came the other voice there was a pause but then juli shoots back with eighteen eighteen cries mrs mcclure who looks like shes about to collapse from relief she pauses then says eighteen going once eighteen going twice sold for eighteen dollars to juli she was the last person i expected to bid on a lunch anybodys lunch jon staggered back into line and i knew i was supposed to step forward but i couldnt budge i felt like id been slugged in the stomach did juli like jon is that why shed been soso nice lately because she didnt care about me anymore all my life shed been there waiting to be avoided and now it was like i didnt even exist step up bryce come on dont be shy mike abenido shoved me a little and said your turn for torture get up there it felt like walking the plank i just stood up front sweating bullets while the booster queen dissected my lunch and started running through my list of favorites before shes even finished though shelly stalls calls out ten whats that says mrs mcclure ill give you ten oh she laughs as she puts down her notes well i guess i hear ten twenty calls miranda humes from dead center twentyfive its shelly again im looking around for jumbo jenny praying shes gone home sick or something while shelly and miranda go up by fives thirty thirtyfive forty then i spot her shes about twenty feet behind miranda cleaning her fingernails with her teeth fortyfive fifty fiftytwo fiftytwo interrupts the booster queen well this has been lively and from the looks of this basket well worth the sixty sixtytwo calls shelly miranda scrambles around trying to beg money off her friends as mrs mcclure calls going once but then jenny stands up and bellows a hundred a hundred theres a collective gasp and then the entire student body turns and stares at jenny well laughs mrs mcclure we have a hundred that is certainly an alltime record and such a generous donation to the boosters i wanted to boost her right off the stage i was doomed this was something i would never live down then theres this big commotion and all of a sudden shelly and miranda are standing right next to each other calling onetwentytwo fifty well give you onetwentytwo fifty one hundred twentytwo dollars and fifty cents i thought the booster queen was gonna polka youre pooling your resources to have lunch with this fine young man yeah they call then look over jennys way everybody looks over jennys way jenny just shrugs and goes back to cleaning a nail well then one hundred twentytwo dollars and fifty cents going once one hundred twentytwo dollars and fifty cents going twice sold to those two beautiful young ladies for an alltime record of one hundred twentytwo dollars and fifty cents dude mike whispered when i got back in line shelly and miranda how am i supposed to follow that he didnt even come close he got terry norris for sixteen bucks and the most anyone else got was forty and when it was over all the guys told me dude you are like the man score but i didnt feel like the man i felt wiped out my mom came up and gave me a hug and a kiss like id won a gold medal or something then whispered my little baby and clickityclicked off in her high heels back to work so i was wiped out embarrassed and then practically dragged to the multipurpose room by shelly and miranda the boosters had outfitted the mpr with little tables for two all decorated in shades
Document 49
of pink and blue and yellow with balloons and streamers everywhere i felt like the easter bunny with my stupid basket boy lunch clutched in both hands while miranda held on to one arm and shelly latched on to the other they gave us the biggest table and whisked in an extra chair and when everyone was seated mrs mcclure said boys and girls i dont think i need to remind you that you are excused from class for the rest of the day enjoy your lunches enjoy your friendships take your time relax and thanks again for supporting your boosters we wouldnt be us without you so there i was with the two hottest girls on campus having lunch i was the man the envy of every other guy in school buddy i was miserable i mean these two girls may be gorgeous but what was coming out of their mouths about jumbo jenny was embarrassingly ugly miranda works herself up to what was she thinking like you would ever want to go out with her right bryce well yeah that was right but it seemed really wrong to say so look can we talk about something else sure like what i dont care anything else you guys going anywhere this summer miranda shoots off first were taking a cruise to the mexican riviera were supposed to stop in all these cool ports and shop and stuff she flutters her eyelids at me and says i could bring you something back shelly scoots her chair in a little and says were going up to the lake my dad has a cabin there and you can get the most outrageous tan do you remember what i looked like at the beginning of this year i was like black im going to do that again only this time ive got a schedule all worked out so that its even every where she giggles and says dont tell my mom okay she would have a kanip and this my friend is how the tan wars began miranda told shelly that she didnt even notice her tan at the beginning of the year and that the place to really roast is on a cruise ship shelly told miranda that anyone with freckles cant really get tan and since miranda had freckles everywhere the cruise was a guaranteed waste of money i choked down my third of the lunch and looked around the room trying to let it all flow past me then i saw juli she was two tables away from me facing my direction only she wasnt looking at me she was looking at jon her eyes all sparkly and laughing my heart lurched what was she laughing about what were they talking about how could she sit there and look so beautiful i felt myself spinning out of control it was weird like i couldnt even steer my own body id always thought jon was pretty cool but right then i wanted to go over and throw him across the room shelly grabbed my arm and said bryce are you all right you looki dont know possessed or something what oh i tried taking a deep breath what are you staring at miranda asked they both looked over their shoulders then shrugged and went back to picking at their food but i couldnt stop myself from looking again and in the back of my mind i could hear my grandfathers voice saying the choices you make now will affect you for the rest of your life do the right thing do the right thing do the right thing miranda shook me out of it asking bryce are you in there i asked what are you going to do this summer i dont know i snapped hey maybe you can spend some time up at the lake with us shelly said it was torture i wanted to scream shut up leave me alone i wanted to run out of the building and keep on running until i didnt feel like this anymore lunch is really delicious bryce mirandas voice was floating around bryce did you hear me this is really a spectacular lunch a simple little thank you wouldve sufficed but could i come up with a simple little thank you no i turned on her and said can we not talk about food or tans or hair she gave me an uppity little smile well what do you want to talk about then i blinked at her then at shelly how about perpetual motion know anything about that perpetual what miranda starts laughing what i ask her whats so funny she looks at me a minute then snickers i didnt realize id bid on an intellectual hey im plenty smart yeah miranda giggles can you spell intellectual he is too smart miranda oh stop kissing up shelly youre trying to tell me youre after his brain god its making me sick to watch you grovel grovel excuse me you heard me hes not going to take you to the grad dance anyway so just give it up why dont you and with that it was all over one of my moms flaky apple tarts got ground into mirandas hair the extra ranch dressing got smeared into shellys and before mrs mcclure could say in the name of boosters what are you doing they were rolling on the floor scratching each others makeup off i took this opportunity to leave my table and head for julis i grabbed her by the hand and said ive got to talk to you she sort of halfstands and says what whats going on bryce why are they fighting excuse us a minute would you jon i pull her away from the table but theres no place to go and ive got her hand in mine and i just cant think so i stop right there in the middle of the room and look at her
Document 50
at that face i want to touch her cheek and see what it feels like i want to touch her hair it looks so incredibly soft bryce she whispers whats wrong i can barely breathe as i ask her do you like him do i you mean jon yes well sure hes nice and no do you like him my heart was pounding through my chest as i took her other hand and waited well no i mean not like that no she said no i didnt care where i was i didnt care who saw i wanted just had to kiss her i leaned in closed my eyes and then she broke away from me suddenly the room was dead quiet miranda and shelly stared at me through their slimy hair everyone was looking at me like id blown my entire circuit board and i just stood there trying to reel in my lips and pull myself back together mrs mcclure took me by the shoulders guided me to my chair and told me you sit here and you stay here then she hauled miranda and shelly outside scolding them and telling them to find separate bathrooms and clean up while she ran down the janitor to mop up their mess i sat there by myself and didnt even care about covering up i just wanted to be with her to talk to her to hold her hand again to kiss her before school was out i tried to talk to her again but every time i got close shed dodge me and then when the final bell rang she disappeared i looked everywhere for her but she was just gone garrett however wasnt he tracked me down and said dude tell me it isnt true i didnt say a word i just headed for the bike racks still hoping to find juli oh man it is true leave me alone garrett you get hooked up with the two finest chicks on campus then bail on them for juli you dont understand youre right dude i completely dont understand did you seriously try to kiss her i couldnt believe that part were talking julianna baker your nightmare neighbor the knowitall nuisance the coop poop babe i stopped cold and shoved him just laid into him with both hands and shoved that was a long time ago man knock it off garrett put both hands up but moved in at me dude you have flipped you know that just back off would you he blocked my path i cant believe this two hours ago you were the man the man the whole school was on their knees before you now look at you youre like a social hazard he snorted and said and dude the truth is if youre gonna be like this i dont need the association i got right in his face and said good cause you know what neither do i i shoved him aside and ran i wound up walking home in my pinchy shoes with dirty dishes clanking inside my sticky picnic hamper this basket boy hiked all the way home and there was a battle raging inside me the old bryce wanted to go back in time wanted to hang with garrett and shoot the breeze wanted to hate juli baker again wanted to be the man but in my heart i knew the old bryce was toast there was no going back not to garrett or shelly or miranda or any of the other people who wouldnt understand juli was different but after all these years that didnt bother me anymore i liked it i liked her and every time i saw her she seemed more beautiful she just seemed to glow im not talking like a hundredwatt bulb she just had this warmth to her maybe it came from climbing that tree maybe it came from singing to chickens maybe it came from whacking at twobyfours and dreaming about perpetual motion i dont know all i know is that compared to her shelly and miranda seemed soordinary id never felt like this before ever and just admitting it to myself instead of hiding from it made me feel strong happy i took off my shoes and socks and stuffed them in the basket my tie whipped over my shoulder as i ran home barefoot and i realized that garrett was right about one thing i had flipped completely i trucked down our street and spotted her bike lying on its side on the driveway she was home i rang the bell until i thought it would break no answer i pounded on her door no answer i went home and called on the phone and finally finally her mother answers bryce no im sorry she doesnt want to talk then she whispers give her a little time wont you i gave her an hour almost then i went across the street please mrs baker ive got to see her shes locked herself in her room dear why dont you try phoning tomorrow tomorrow i couldnt wait until tomorrow so i went around the side of their house climbed the fence and knocked on her window juli juli please ive got to see you her curtains didnt open but the back door did and out came mrs baker to shoo me away when i got home my granddad was waiting at the front door bryce what is going on youve been running back and forth to the bakers climbing over their fence youre acting like the worlds on fire i blurted i cant believe this i just cant believe this she wont talk to me he led me into the front room saying who wont talk to you juli he hesitated is she mad at you i dont know does she have reason to be mad at you no yes i mean i dont know well what happened i tried to kiss her

Document 52
its a joke he said its embarrassing who wants to be a basket boy all the guys around him muttered not me but mrs simmons cleared her throat and said you should want to be one its a tradition that has helped support the school since it was founded there have been generation after generation of basket boys helping make this campus what it is today its why we have flower beds its why we have shade trees and a grove of apple trees visit another junior high sometime and youll begin to realize what a little oasis our campus really is all this from the sweat and blood of basket boys robbie grumbled mrs simmons sighed robbie someday when your children go to school here youll understand for now please just vote for whoever you think will earn a high bid and class she added were down to nine minutes the room fell quiet and as i read down the list of over one hundred and fifty eighthgrade boys i realized that to me there had only ever been one boy to me there had only been bryce i didnt let myself get sentimental i had liked him for all the wrong reasons and i certainly wasnt going to vote for him now but i didnt know who else to vote for i looked at mrs simmons who was eagleeyeing the class between glances at the clock what if i didnt choose anybody what if i just turned it in blank shed give me detention thats what so with two minutes left to go i put dots next to the boys i knew who werent jerks or clowns but were just nice when i was through there were all of ten names with dots and of those i circled five ryan noll vince olson adrian iglesias ian lai and jon trulock they wouldnt make basket boy but then i wouldnt be bidding so it didnt really matter at the bell i handed over my ballot and forgot all about the auction until lunchtime the next day that is darla cut me off on my way to the library and dragged me over to her table instead have you seen the list she asked what list the list of basket boys she shoved a scrawled copy of twenty names in front of me and looked around your main dish is on it five from the top there it wasbryce loski i should have expected it but still this awful surge of possessiveness shot through me who had voted for him out of one hundred fifty names he must have gotten a lot of votes suddenly i was picturing a swarm of girls waving stacks of cash in the booster ladies faces as they begged to have lunch with him i threw the list back at darla and said hes not my main dish as a matter of fact i didnt even vote for him oooo girl you are stickin to your diet its not a diet darla im im over him okay im glad to hear it cause rumor is that bimbette shelly is already stakin her claim on him shelly shelly stalls i could feel my cheeks flush thats right darla waved her list in the air calling liz macy over here ive got the list darlas friends fell all over themselves getting to her then pored over the paper like it was a treasure map macy cried chad ormondes on it he is so cute id go ten bucks on him easy and dennys on it too liz squealed that boy is she shivered and giggledfiyiyine macys top lip curled a little and she said jon trulock jon tru lock how did he get on this list for a moment i couldnt believe my ears i snatched the paper out of macys hand are you sure right there she said pointing to his name who do you suppose voted for him the quiet girls i guess darla said me im more interested in mike abenido have i got any competition macy laughed if youre in im out me too said liz how about you jules darla asked me bringin spare change on friday no you get to miss the second half of school no im not bidding not on anyone she laughed good for you that afternoon i rode home from school brooding about bryce and the whole basket boy auction i could feel myself backsliding about bryce but why should i care if shelly liked him i shouldnt even be thinking about him when i wasnt thinking about bryce i was worrying about poor jon trulock he was quiet and i felt sorry for him having to clutch a basket and be auctioned off in front of the whole student body what had i done to him but as i bounced up our drive basket boys bounced right out of my mind was that green i saw poking out of the dirt yes yes it was i dropped the bike and got down on my hands and knees they were so thin so small so far apart they barely made a difference in the vastness of the black dirt and yet there they were pushing their way through to the afternoon sun i ran in the house calling mom mom theres grass really she emerged from the bathroom with her cleaning gloves and a pail i was wondering if it was ever going to spring up well it has come come and see she wasnt too impressed at first but after i made her get down on her hands and knees and really look she smiled and said theyre so delicate they look like theyre yawning dont they she cocked her head a bit and looked a little closer yawning well more stretching i guess like theyre sitting up in their little bed of dirt with their arms stretched way high saying good morning world she laughed

and said yes they do i got up and uncoiled the hose i think they need a wakeup shower dont you my mom agreed and left me to my singing and sprinkling and i was completely lost in the joy of my little green blades of new life when i heard the school bus rumble to a stop up on collier street bryce his name shot through my brain and with it came a panic i didnt seem able to control before i could stop myself i dropped the hose and dashed inside i locked myself in my room and tried to do my homework where was my peace where was my resolve where was my sanity had they left me because shelly stalls was after him was it just some old rivalry making me feel this way i had to get past bryce and shelly they deserved each otherlet them have each other but in my heart i knew that just like the new grass i wasnt strong enough yet to be walked on and until i was there was only one solution i had to stay away from him i needed to rope him out of my life so i closed my ears to the news of basket boys and steered clear of bryce at school and when i did happen to run into him i simply said hello like he was someone i barely even knew it was working too i was growing stronger by the day who cared about auctions and basket boys i didnt friday morning i got up early collected what few eggs there were in the coop watered the front yard which was by now definitely green ate breakfast and got ready for school but as i was running a brush through my hair i couldnt help thinking about shelly stalls it was auction day shed probably been up since five making her hair into some impossibly pouffy do so what i told myself so what but as i was throwing on my windbreaker i eyed my money tin and hesitated what if no nonono i ran to the garage got my bike and pushed out of the driveway and i was in the street and on my way when mrs stueby flew right in my path julianna she called waving her hand through the air here dear take this im so sorry its taken me this long to get it to you i keep missing you in the mornings i didnt even know how much she owed me at that moment i didnt care all i knew was the top bill in her hand was a ten and it was striking terror in my heart mrs stueby please i i dont want that you dont have to pay me nonsense child of course im going to pay you here she said and waved it out for me to take no really i i dont want it she wedged it in the pocket of my jeans and said what utter nonsense now go go buy yourself a rooster then hurried back up her walkway mrs stueby mrs stueby i called after her i dont want a rooster but she was gone all the way to school mrs stuebys money was burning a hole in my pocket and another in my brain how much was it when i got to school i parked my bike then broke down and looked ten fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen i folded the bills together and slid them back into my pocket was it more than shelly had all through first period i was furious with myself for even thinking it all through second period i kept my eyes off of bryce but oh it was so hard id never seen him in a tie and cuff links before then at break i was at my locker when shelly stalls appeared out of nowhere she got right next to me and said i hear youre planning to bid on him what i took a step back who told you that i am not someone said they saw you with a whole wad of cash this morning how much do you have its its none of your business and im not bidding okay i i dont even like him anymore she laughed oh thatll be the day its true i slammed my locker closed go ahead and waste your money on him i dont care i left her there with her mouth open which felt even better than getting her in a headlock that feeling carried me clear through to eleven oclock when the entire student body assembled in the gymnasium i was not going to bid on bryce loski no way then the basket boys came out on the stage bryce looked so adorable holding a picnic basket with redandwhitechecked napkins peeking out from either side and the thought of shelly stalls flipping one of those napkins into her lap nearly made the bills in my pocket burst into flames darla came up behind me and whispered rumor is youve got a wad of cash is that true what no i mean yes but i im not bidding oooo girl look at you you feelin all right i wasnt i felt sick to my stomach and shaky in the knees im fine i told her fine she looked from me to the stage and back to me you got nothin to lose but your self respect stop it i whispered at her fiercely it felt like i was having a panic attack i couldnt breathe i felt lightheaded and wobblylike i wasnt in control of my own body darla said maybe you should sit down im fine darla im fine she frowned at me i think ill stick around to make sure the booster club president mrs mcclure had been fluttering around the basket boys fixing ties and giving them lastminute instructions but now suddenly she was slamming her

gavel on the podium calling into the microphone if youll all settle down were ready to begin id never seen six hundred kids quiet down so fast i guess mrs mcclure hadnt either because she smiled and said why thank you thank you very much then she said and welcome to the fiftysecond annual basket boy auction i know that your teachers have gone over the procedures with you in homeroom but ive been asked to remind you of a few things this is a civilized proceeding no whistling catcalls or other degrading behavior will be tolerated if you wish to place a bid you must raise your hand high bidding without raising your hand is prohibited and should you decide to be a funny guy you will be caught and detained or suspended are we all clear on that good she looked from one side of the gym to the other teachers i see that you are in position six hundred heads turned slowly from side to side looking at the blockade of teachers on either side of the gym man darla whispered theyre not leaving much room for fun are they mrs mcclure continued minimum bid is ten dollars and of course the skys the limit but we dont accept ious she pointed to her right winning bidders should go directly to the table at the north door when i declare the basket to be sold and as youre aware winners and their basket boys have the rest of the school day off and are exempt from tonights homework in all classes she smiled out at the blockade teachers we appreciate your support on this all right then she put on her reading glasses and looked at a threebyfive card our first basket has been brought by jeffrey bisho she looked over her glasses at him and said come on up jeffrey dont be shy he inched forward as she continued jeffrey has brought a scrumptious lunch consisting of chicken salad sandwiches oriental noodles baby grapes iced tea and fortune cookies she smiled at him over her glasses sounds delicious and sounds like fun which she said looking back at the crowd jeffrey is he enjoys skateboarding skiing and swimming but ladies he also enjoys a day in the park and watching humphrey bogart movies she turned to him and grinned they are a kick arent they poor jeff tried to smile but you could tellhe wanted to die all right then said mrs mcclure as she whipped off her glasses do i hear ten not only did she hear ten she heard twelve fifteen twenty and twentyfive too going going gone cried mrs mcclure to the young lady in the purple tunic who is that i asked darla i think her names tiffany she said shes a seventh grader really wow i would never have bid last year and i i dont remember bids going up that high either darla eyed me which tells me that maybe you would bid this year how much you got i looked at her and almost dissolved right on the spot darla i didnt bring money on purpose my neighbor made me take it on the way to school because she owed it to me for eggs and for eggs oh like bryce was talking about in the library exactly and i looked at her looking at me and stopped cold how can you even think about bidding on that boy i dont want to but ive liked him for so long darla ive liked him since i was seven and even though i know hes a coward and a sneak and i should never speak to him again im having trouble focusing on that especially since shelly stalls is after him and now ive got this money burning a hole in my pocket well i can understand the bit about shelly stalls but if you know that boys just a big piece of fluffy cheesecake that youre gonna regret eating i can help you with your diet she put out her hand give me the money ill hold it for you no no i meani can handle this ive got to handle it she shook her head oh girl im hurting for you here i looked back at the stage the auction was happening so fast theyd be at bryce in no time as the bidding continued the battle in my head got louder and fiercer what was i going to do then suddenly the gym fell quiet you could have heard a pin drop and standing next to mrs mcclure looking completely mortified was jon trulock mrs mcclure was scouring the crowd with her eyes looking very uncomfortable too what happened i whispered to darla no ones bidding she whispered back do i hear ten called mrs mcclure come on out there this lunch is delicious strawberry tarts roast beef and muenster cheese sandwiches oh no i whispered to darla i cant believe i did this to him you what did you do i voted for him well you couldnt have been the only one but why isnt anyone bidding on him hes hes so nice darla nodded exactly thats when i realized what i had to do my hand shot into the air and i called ten ten warbled mrs mcclure did i hear ten i put my hand up higher and said to darla say twelve what say twelve ill outbid you no way darla he cant go for ten cmon twelve darla called but her hand didnt go up very high fifteen i cried sixteen called darla and eyed me with a laugh i whispered darla ive only got fifteen her eyes got enormous i laughed and called eighteen then held her arm

girl what a rush i nodded yes it was well no dessert for you looks like you got cleaned out by something a little more uh nutritious she nodded toward the stage you gonna go up to the table like youre supposed to or you gonna stick around and see the carnage i almost didnt have a choice before mrs mcclure could say two words about bryce or his basket shelly called ten then from the middle of the gym came twenty it was miranda humes with her hand way in the air they went back and forth back and forth higher and higher until shelly called sixtytwo i cant believe it i whispered to darla sixtytwo dollars cmon miranda come on i think shes out shellys got it sixtytwo dollars going once cried mrs mcclure but before she could say going twice a voice from the back of the gym called a hundred everyone gasped and turned around to see who had called the bid darla whispered its jenny atkinson i asked darla pointed right over there she was easy to spot standing tall above the others in the numberseven basketball jersey she almost always wore wow i whispered i had no idea maybe shell slamdunk him for you darla said with a grin who cares i giggled she slamdunked shelly mrs mcclure was gushing into the microphone about the recordbreaking bid when a big commotion broke out over by miranda i spotted shellys hair and my first thought was that there was going to be a fight but instead shelly and miranda turned to face mrs mcclure and called onetwentytwo fifty i choked down a cry what theyre teamin up darla whispered oh nonono i looked over jennys way come on jenny darla shook her head and said shes through and she was bryce went to shelly and miranda for one hundred twentytwo dollars and fifty cents it was a little strange meeting up with jon and walking over to the multipurpose room for lunch but he was just so nice and i think grateful that id bid that by the time we got situated at our table i wasnt feeling so awkward or silly it was just lunch things would have been easier if they hadnt seated me in direct view of bryce and his little harem but i did my best to ignore them jon told me all about this radiocontrolled airplane that he and his dad were building from scratch and how hed been working on it for nearly three months and that over the weekend they were finally going to get to try it out he told me a funny story about soldering the wires wrong and practically starting a fire in their basement and i asked him about how a radiocontrolled airplane works because i didnt really understand it so id relaxed a lot and was actually having a good time eating lunch with jon and i was so relieved that i hadnt bid on bryce what a fool i would have made of myself watching shelly and miranda fawning all over him didnt bother me nearly as much as i thought it would really they looked ridiculous jon asked about my family so i was telling him about my brothers and their band when a huge commotion broke out over at bryces table suddenly shelly and miranda were rolling on the floor like an enormous furball smearing each other with food out of nowhere bryce appeared at our table he grabbed my hand pulled me a few feet away and whispered do you like him i was stunned he held my other hand and asked again do you like him you mean jon yes i cant remember what i said he was looking into my eyes holding my hands tight and then he began pulling me toward him my heart was racing and his eyes were closing and his face was coming toward mine right there in front of all the other basket boys and their dates and the adults he was going to kiss me to kiss me i panicked id been waiting all my life for that kiss and now i yanked free and ran back to my table and when i sat down jon whispered did he just try to kiss you i turned my chair away from bryce and whispered can we please talk about something else anything else people were whispering and looking my way and when shelly stalls came back from cleaning up in the washroom everyone fell quiet her hair looked awful it was sort of oiled to her scalp and still had little chunks of food in it she glared at me so hard it looked like she was trying to get laser beams to shoot from her eyes a couple of adults steered her back to her seat and then everyone started whispering doublespeed and bryce didnt even seem to care he kept trying to come over and talk to me but either hed get intercepted by a teacher or id dash away from him before he had a chance to say anything when the dismissal bell finally rang i said a quick goodbye to jon and bolted out the door i couldnt reach my bike fast enough i was the first one off campus and i pedaled home so hard it felt as though my lungs would burst mrs stueby was out front watering her flower bed and she tried to say something to me but i just dropped my bike in the driveway and escaped into the house i certainly didnt want to talk about roosters my mother heard me slamming doors and came to check on me in my room julianna whats wrong i flipped over on my bed to face her and wailed i am so confused i dont know what to think or feel or do she sat down beside me on the bed and stroked my hair

tell me what happened sweetheart i hesitated then threw my hands up in the air he tried to kiss me my mother struggled not to let it show but underneath her composed expression was a growing smile she leaned in a little and asked who did bryce she hesitated but youve always liked him the doorbell rang and rang again my mom started to get up but i grabbed her arm and said dont get that the bell rang again and almost right after that there was a loud knocking at the door mom please dont get it thats probably him but sweetheart i was over him completely over him since when since last friday after the dinner if he had vanished from the face of the earth after our dinner at the loskis i wouldnt have cared why did something happen at the dinner that i dont know about i threw myself back onto my pillow and said its too complicated mom i i just cant talk about it my she said after a moment dont you sound like a teenager im sorry i whimpered because i knew i was hurting her feelings i sat up and said mom all those years i liked him i never really knew him all i knew was that he had the most beautiful eyes id ever seen and that his smile melted my heart like the sun melts butter but now i know that inside hes a coward and a sneak so ive got to get over what hes like on the outside my mother leaned back and crossed her arms well she said isnt this something what do you mean she chewed the side of one cheek then moved over to chew the other at last she said i shouldnt really discuss it why not because i just shouldnt besides i can tell there are things you dont feel comfortable discussing with me we stared at each other a moment neither of us saying a word finally i looked down and whispered when chet and i were fixing up the yard i told him how we didnt own the house and about uncle david he must have told the rest of the family because the day before the loskis dinner party i overheard bryce and his friend making cracks about uncle david at school i was furious but i didnt want you to know because youd think they were only inviting us over because they felt sorry for us i looked at her and said you just seemed so happy about being invited for dinner then i realized something and you know youve seemed happier ever since she held my hand and smiled i have a lot to be happy about then she sighed and said and i already knew they knew about uncle david it was fine that you talked about him hes not a secret or anything i sat up a little wait how did you know patsy told me i blinked at her she did before the dinner no no after she hesitated then said patsys been over several times this week shes shes going through a very rough time how come mom let out a deep breath and said i think youre mature enough to keep this inside these four walls and im only telling you because because i think its relevant i held my breath and waited patsy and rick have been having ferocious fights lately mr and mrs loski what about mom sighed about everything it seems i dont understand very quietly my mother said for the first time in her life patsy is seeing her husband for what he is its twenty years and two children late but thats what shes doing she gave me a sad smile patsy seems to be going through the same thing you are the phone rang and mom said let me get that okay your dad said hed call if he was working overtime and thats probably him while she was gone i remembered what chet had said about someone he knew who had never learned to look beneath the surface had he been talking about his own daughter and how could this happen to her after twenty years of marriage when my mother came back i absently asked is dad working late that wasnt dad sweetheart it was bryce i sat straight up now hes calling i have lived across the street from him for six years and hes never once called me is he doing this because hes jealous jealous of whom so i gave her the blowbyblow beginning with mrs stueby going clear through darla the auction the furball fight and ending with bryce trying to kiss me in front of everybody she clapped her hands and positively giggled mom its not funny she tried to straighten up i know sweetheart i know i dont want to wind up like mrs loski you dont have to marry the boy julianna why dont you just listen to what he has to say he sounded desperate to talk to you what could he possibly have to say hes already tried to blame garrett for what he said about uncle david and im sorry but i dont buy it hes lied to me he hasnt stood up for me hes hes nobody that i want to like i just need some time to get over all those years of having liked him mom sat there for the longest time biting her cheek then she said people do change you know maybe hes had some revelations lately too and frankly any boy who tries to kiss a girl in front of a room full of other kids does not sound like a coward to me she stroked my hair and whispered maybe theres more to bryce loski than you know then she left me alone with my thoughts my mother knew i needed time to think but bryce wouldnt

leave me alone he kept calling on the phone and knocking on the door he even snuck around the house and tapped on my window every time i turned around there he was pestering me i wanted to be able to water the yard in peace i wanted not to have to avoid him at school or have darla run block for me why didnt he understand that i wasnt interested in what he had to say what could he possibly have to say was it so much to ask just to be left alone then this afternoon i was reading a book in the front room with the curtains drawn hiding from him as i had all week when i heard a noise in the yard i peeked outside and there was bryce walking across my grass stomping all over my grass and he was carrying a spade what was he planning to do with that i flew off the couch and yanked open the door and ran right into my father stop him i cried calm down julianna he said and eased me back inside i gave him permission permission permission to do what i flew back to the window hes digging a hole thats right i told him he could but why i think the boy has a very good idea thats why but its not going to kill your grass julianna just let him do what hes come to do but what is it whats he doing watch youll figure it out it was torture seeing him dig up my grass the hole he was making was enormous how could my father let him do this to my yard bryce knew i was there too because he looked at me once and nodded no smile no wave just a nod he dragged over some potting soil pierced the bag with the spade and shoveled dirt into the hole then he disappeared and when he came back he wrestled a big burlapped root ball across the lawn the branches of a plant rustling back and forth as he moved my dad joined me on the couch and peeked out the window too a tree i whispered hes planting a tree id help him but he says he has to do this himself is it a the words stuck in my throat i didnt really need to ask though and he knew he didnt need to answer i could tell from the shape of the leaves from the texture of the trunk this was a sycamore tree i flipped around on the couch and just sat a sycamore tree bryce finished planting the tree watered it cleaned everything up and then went home and i just sat there not knowing what to do ive been sitting here for hours now just staring out the window at the tree it may be little now but itll grow day by day and a hundred years from now itll reach clear over the rooftops itll be miles in the air already i can tellits going to be an amazing magnificent tree and i cant help wondering a hundred years from now will a kid climb it the way i climbed the one up on collier street will she see the things i did will she feel the way i did will it change her life the way it changed mine i also cant stop wondering about bryce what has he been trying to tell me whats he thinking about i know hes home because he looks out his window from time to time a little while ago he put his hand up and waved and i couldnt help iti gave a little wave back so maybe i should go over there and thank him for the tree maybe we could sit on the porch and talk it just occurred to me that in all the years weve known each other weve never done that never really talked maybe my mothers right maybe there is more to bryce loski than i know maybe its time to meet him in the proper light project gutenbergs the historical nights entertainment by rafael sabatini title the historical nights entertainment author rafael sabatini preface in approaching the historical nights entertainment i set myself the task of reconstructing in the fullest possible detail and with all the colour available from surviving records a group of more or less famous events i would select for my purpose those which were in themselves bizarre and resulting from the interplay of human passions and whilst relating each of these events in the form of a story i would compel that story scrupulously to follow the actual recorded facts without owing anything to fiction and i would draw upon my imagination if at all merely as one might employ colour to fill in the outlines which history leaves grey taking care that my colour should be as true to nature as possible for dialogue i would depend upon such scraps of actual speech as were chronicled in each case amplifying it by translating into terms of speech the paraphrases of contemporary chroniclers such was the task i set myself i am aware that it has been attempted once or twice already beginning perhaps with the crimes celebres of alexandre dumas i am not aware that the attempt has ever succeeded this is not to say that i claim success in the essays that follow how nearly i may have approached successjudged by the standard i had set myselfhow far i may have fallen short my readers will discern i am conscious however of having in the main dutifully resisted the temptation to take the easier road to break away from restricting fact for the sake of achieving a more intriguing narrative in one instance however i have quite deliberately failed and in some others i have permitted myself certain speculations to resolve mysteries of which no explanation has been discovered of
Document 58
these it is necessary that i should make a full confession my deliberate failure is the night of nuptials i discovered an allusion to the case of charles the bold and sapphira danvelt in macaulays history of englandquoted from an old number of the spectatorwhilst i was working upon the case of lady alice lisle there a similar episode is mentioned as being related of colonel kirke but discredited because known for a story that has a trick of springing up to attach itself to unscrupulous captains i set out to track it to its source and having found its first appearance to be in connection with charles the bolds german captain rhynsault i attempted to reconstruct the event as it might have happened setting it at least in surroundings of solid fact my most flagrant speculation occurs in the night of hate but in defence of it i can honestly say that it is at least no more flagrant than the speculations on this subject that have become enshrined in history as facts in other words i claim for my reconstruction of the circumstances attending the mysterious death of giovanni borgia duke of gandia that it no more lacks historical authority than do any other of the explanatory narratives adopted by history to assign the guilt to gandias brother cesare borgia in the cambridge modern history our most authoritative writers on this epoch have definitely pronounced that there is no evidence acceptable to historians to support the view current for four centuries that cesare borgia was the murderer elsewhere i have dealt with this at length here let it suffice to say that it was not until nine months after the deed that the name of cesare borgia was first associated with it that public opinion had in the mean time assigned the guilt to a halfdozen others in succession that no motive for the crime is discoverable in the case of cesare that the motives advanced will not bear examination and that they bear on the face of them the stamp of having been put forward hastily to support an accusation unscrupulously political in purpose that the first men accused by the popular voice were the cardinal vicechancellor ascanio sforza and his nephew giovanni sforza tyrant of pesaro and finally that in matarazzos chronicles of perugia there is a fairly detailed account of how the murder was perpetrated by the latter matarazzo i confess is worthy of no more credit than any other of the contemporary reporters of common gossip but at least he is worthy of no less and it is undeniable that in sforzas case a strong motive for the murder was not lacking my narrative in the night of hate is admittedly a purely theoretical account of the crime but it is closely based upon all the known facts of incidence and of character and if there is nothing in the surviving records that will absolutely support it neither is there anything that can absolutely refute it in the night of masquerade i am guilty of quite arbitrarily discovering a reason to explain the mystery of baron bjelkes sudden change from the devoted friend and servant of gustavus iii of sweden into his most bitter enemy that speculation is quite indefensible although affording a possible explanation of that mystery in the case of the night of kirk o field on the other hand i do not think any apology is necessary for my reconstruction of the precise manner in which darnley met his death the event has long been looked upon as one of the mysteries of historythe mystery lying in the fact that whilst the house at kirk o field was destroyed by an explosion darnleys body was found at some distance away together with that of his page bearing every evidence of death by strangulation the explanation i adopt seems to me to owe little to speculation in the story of antonio perezthe night of betrayali have permitted myself fewer liberties with actual facts than might appear i have closely followed his own relacion which whilst admittedly a piece of special pleading must remain the most authoritative document of the events with which it deals all that i have done has been to reverse the values as perez presents them throwing the personal elements into higher relief than the political ones and laying particular stress upon the matter of his relations with the princess of eboli the night of betrayal is presented in the form of a story within a story of the containing story let me say that whilst to some extent it is fictitious it is by no means entirely so there is enough to justify most of it in the relaciori itself the exceptions mentioned being made i hope it may be found that i have adhered rigorously to my purpose of owing nothing to invention in my attempt to flesh and clothe these few bones of history i should add perhaps that where authorities differ as to motives where there is a conflict of evidence as to the facts themselves or where the facts admit of more than one interpretation i have permitted myself to be selective and confined myself to a point of view adopted at the outset r s london august contents i the night of holyrood the murder of david rizzio ii the night of kirk o field the murder of darnley iii the night of betrayal antonio perez

of hate the murder of the duke of gandia xii the night of escape casanovas escape from the piombi xiii the night of masquerade the assassination of gustavus iii of sweden the historical nights entertainment i the night of holyroodthe murder of david rizzio the tragedy of my lord darnleys life lay in the fact that he was a man born out of his proper stationa clown destined to kingship by the accident of birth and fortune by the blood royal flowing in his veins he could failing others have claimed succession to both the english and the scottish thrones whilst by his marriage with mary stuart he made a definite attempt to possess himself of that of scotland the queen of scots enamoured for a season of the cleanlimbed grace and almost feminine beauty ladyfaced melville had called him once of this long lad of nineteen who came awooing her had soon discovered in matrimony his vain debauched shiftless and cowardly nature she had married him in july of and by michaelmas she had come to know him for just a lovely husk of a man empty of heart or brain and the knowledge transmuted affection into contempt her natural brother the earl of murray had opposed the marriage chiefly upon the grounds that darnley was a catholic and with argyll chatellerault glencairn and a host of other protestant lords had risen in arms against his sovereign and her consort but mary had chased her rebel brother and his fellows over the border into england and by this very action taken for the sake of her worthless husband she sowed the first seeds of discord between herself and him it happened that stout service had been rendered her in this affair by the arrogant border ruffian the earl of bothwell partly to reward him partly because of the confidence with which he inspired her she bestowed upon him the office of lieutenantgeneral of the east middle and west marchesan office which darnley had sought for his father lennox that was the first and last concerted action of the royal couple estrangement grew thereafter between them and in a measure as it grew so did darnleys kingship hardly established as yetfor the queen had still to redeem her prenuptial promise to confer upon him the crown matrimonialbegin to dwindle at first it had been the king and queen or his majesty and hers but by christmasfive months after the weddingdarnley was known simply as the queens husband and in all documents the queens name now took precedence of his whilst coins bearing their two heads and the legend hen et maria were called in and substituted by a new coinage relegating him to the second place deeply affronted and seeking anywhere but in himself and his own shortcomings the cause of the queens now manifest hostility he presently conceived that he had found it in the influence exerted upon her by the seigneur daviethat piedmontese david rizzio who had come to the scottish court some four years ago as a starveling minstrel in the train of monsieur de morette the ambassador of savoy it was rizzios skill upon the rebec that had first attracted marys attention later he had become her secretary for french affairs and the young queen reared amid the elegancies of the court of france grew attached to him as to a fellowexile in the uncouth and turbulent land over which a harsh destiny ordained that she should rule using his opportunities and his subtle italian intelligence he had advanced so rapidly that soon there was no man in scotland who stood higher with the queen when maitland of lethington was dismissed under suspicion of favouring the exiled protestant lords the seigneur davie succeeded him as her secretary and now that morton was under the same suspicion it was openly said that the seigneur davie would be made chancellor in his stead thus the seigneur davie was become the most powerful man in scotland and it is not to be dreamt that a dour stiffnecked nobility would suffer it without demur they intrigued against him putting it abroad amongst other things that this foreign upstart was an emissary of the popes scheming to overthrow the protestant religion in scotland but in the duel that followed their blunt scotch wits were no match for his italian subtlety intrigue as they might his power remained unshaken and then at last it began to be whispered that he owed his high favour with the beautiful young queen to other than his secretarial abilities so that bedford wrote to cecil what countenance the queen shows david i will not write for the honour due to the person of a queen this bruit found creditindeed there have been ever since those who have believed itand as it spread it reached the ears of darnley because it afforded him an explanation of the queens hostility since he was without the introspection that would have discovered the true explanation in his own shortcomings he flung it as so much fuel upon the seething fires of his rancour and became the most implacable of those who sought the ruin of rizzio he sent for ruthven the friend of murray and the exiled lordsexiled remember on darnleys own accountand offered to procure the reinstatement of those outlaws if they would avenge his honour and make him king of scots in something more than name ruthven sick of a mortal illness having risen from a bed of pain to come in answer to that summons listened dourly to the frothing speeches of that silly lovely boy no doubt youll be right about yon fellow davie he agreed sombrely and purposely he added things that must have outraged darnleys every feeling as king and as husband then he stated the terms on which darnley might count upon his aid early next month parliament is to meet over the business of a bill of attainder against murray and his

friends declaring them by their rebellion to have forfeited life land and goods ye can see the power with her o this foreign fiddler that it drives her so to attaint her own brother murray has ever hated davie knowing too much of what lies twixt the queen and him to her dishonour and master davie thinks so to make an end of murray and his hatred darnley clenched teeth and hands tortured by the craftily administered poison what then what is to do he cried ruthven told him bluntly that bill must never pass parliament must never meet to pass it you are her graces husband and king of scots in name sneered darnley bitterly the name will serve said ruthven in that name yell sign me a bond of formal remission to murray and his friends for all their actions and quarrels permitting their safe return to scotland and charging the lieges to convoy them safely do that and leave the rest to us if darnley hesitated at all it was not because he perceived the irony of the situationthat he himself in secret opposition to the queen should sign the pardon of those who had rebelled against her precisely because she had taken him to husband he hesitated because indecision was inherent in his nature and then he asked at last ruthvens bloodinjected eyes considered him stonily out of a livid gleaming face then whether you reign with her or without her reign you shall as king o scots i pledge myself to that and i pledge those others so that we have the bond darnley sat down to sign the death warrant of the seigneur davie it was the night of saturday the th of march a fire of pine logs burned fragrantly on the hearth of the small closet adjoining the queens chamber suffusing it with a sense of comfort the greater by contrast with the cheerlessness out of doors where an easterly wind swept down from arthurs seat and moaned its dismal way over a snowclad world the lovely goldenheaded young queen supped with a little company of intimates her natural sister the countess of argyll the commendator of holyrood beaton the master of the household arthur erskine the captain of the guard and one otherthat david rizzio who from an errant minstrel had risen to this perilous eminence a man of a swarthy illfavoured countenance redeemed by the intelligence that glowed in his dark eyes and of a body so slight and fragile as to seem almost misshapen his age was not above thirty yet indifferent health early privation and misfortune had so set their mark upon him that he had all the appearance of a man of fifty he was dressed with sombre magnificence and a jewel of great price smouldered upon the middle finger of one of his slender delicate hands supper was at an end the queen lounged on a long seat over against the tapestried wall the countess of argyll in a tall chair on the queens left sat with elbows on the table watching the seigneur davies fine fingers as they plucked softly at the strings of a longnecked lute the talk which intimate and untrammelled had lately been of the child of which her majesty was to be delivered some three months hence was flagging now and it was to fill the gap that rizzio had taken up the lute his harsh countenance was transfigured as he caressed the strings his soul absorbed in the theme of his inspiration very softlyindeed no more than tentatively as yethe was beginning one of those wistful airs in which his spirit survives in scotland to this day when suddenly the expectant hush was broken by a clash of curtainrings the tapestries that masked the door had been swept aside and on the threshold unheralded stood the tall stripling figure of the young king darnleys appearance abruptly scattered the italians inspiration the melody broke off sharply on the single loud note of a string too rudely plucked that and the silence that followed it irked them all conveying a sense that here something had been broken which never could be made whole again darnley shuffled forward his handsome face was pale save for the two burning spots upon his cheekbones and his eyes glittered feveredly he had been drinking so much was clear and that he should seek the queen thus who so seldom sought her sober angered those intimates who had come to share her wellfounded dislike of him king though he might be in name into such contempt was he fallen that not one of them rose in deference whilst mary herself watched his approach with hostile mistrusting eyes what is it my lord she asked him coldly as he flung himself down on the settle beside her he leered at her put an arm about her waist pulled her to him and kissed her oafishly none stirred all eyes were upon them and all faces blank after all he was the king and she his wife and then upon the silence ominous as the very steps of doom came a ponderous clanking tread from the anteroom beyond again the curtains were thrust aside and the countess of argyll uttered a gasp of sudden fear at the grim spectre she beheld there it was a figure armed as for a tourney in gleaming steel from head to foot girt with a sword the right hand resting upon the hilt of the heavy dagger in the girdle the helmets vizor was raised revealing the ghastly face of ruthvenso ghastly that it must have seemed the face of a dead man but for the blazing life in the eyes that scanned the company those questing eyes went round the table settled upon rizzio and seemed horribly to smile startled disquieted by this apparition the queen half rose darnleys hindering arm still flung about her waist whats this she cried her voice

sharp and then as if she guessed intuitively what it might portend she considered her husband with palefaced contempt judas she called him flung away from his detaining arm and stood forth to confront that man in steel what seek ye here my lordand in this guise was her angry challenge ruthvens burning eyes fell away before her glance he clanked forward a step or two flung out a mailed arm and with a hand that shook pointed to the seigneur davie who stood blankly watching him i seek yon man he said gruffly let him come forth he is here by my will she told him her anger mounting and so are not youfor which you shall be made to answer then to darnley who sat hunched on the settle what does this mean sir she demanded whyhow should i know whywhy nothing he faltered foolishly pray god that you are right said she for your own sake and you she continued addressing ruthven again and waving a hand in imperious dismissal be you gone and wait until i send for you which i promise you shall be right soon if she divined some of the evil of their purpose if any fear assailed her yet she betrayed nothing of it she was finely tempered steel but ruthven sullen and menacing stood his ground let yon man come forth he repeated he has been here ower lang over long she echoed betrayed by her quick resentment aye ower lang for the good o scotland and your husband was the brutal answer erskine of her guards leapt to his feet will you begone sir he cried and after him came beaton and the commendator both echoing the captains threatening question a smile overspread ruthvens livid face the heavy dagger flashed from his belt my affair is not with any o ye but if ye thrust yersels too close upon my notice the queen stepped clear of the table to intervene lest violence should be done here in her presence rizzio who had risen stood now beside her watching all with a white startled face and then before more could be said the curtains were torn away and half a score of men whose approach had passed unnoticed poured into the room first came morton the chancellor who was to be dispossessed of the great seal in rizzios favour after him followed the brutal lindsay of the byres kerr of faudonside blackbrowed brunston redheaded douglas and a halfdozen others confusion ensued the three men of the queens household were instantly surrounded and overpowered in the brief sharp struggle the table was overturned and all would have been in darkness but that as the table went over the countess of argyll had snatched up the candlebranch and stood now holding it aloft to light that extraordinary scene rizzio to whom the sight of morton had been as the removal of his last illusion flung himself upon his knees before the queen frail and feeble of body and never a man of his hands he was hopelessly unequal to the occasion justice madame he cried faites justice sauvez ma vie fearlessly she stepped between him and the advancing horde of murderers making of her body a buckler for his protection white of face with heaving bosom and eyes like two glowing sapphires she confronted them back on your lives she bade them but they were lost to all sense of reverence even to all sense of decency in their blind rage against this foreign upstart who had trampled their scottish vanity in the dust george douglas without regard for her condition either as queen or womanand a woman almost upon the threshold of motherhoodclapped a pistol to her breast and roughly bade her stand aside undaunted she looked at him with eyes that froze his triggerfinger whilst behind her rizzio grovelled in his terror clutching her petticoat thus until suddenly she was seized about the waist and half dragged halflifted aside by darnley who at the same time spurned rizzio forward with his foot the murderers swooped down upon their prey kerr of faudonside flung a noose about his body and drew it tight with a jerk that pulled the secretary from his knees then he and morton took the rope between them and so dragged their victim across the room towards the door he struggled blindly as he went vainly clutching first at an overset chair then at a leg of the table and screeching piteously the while to the queen to save him and mary trembling with passion herself struggling in the arms of darnley flung an angry warning after them if davies blood be spilt it shall be dear blood to some of you remember that sirs but they were beyond control by now hounds unleashed upon the quarry of their hate out of her presence morton and douglas dragged him the rest of the baying pack going after them they dragged him screeching still across the antechamber to the head of the great stairs and there they fell on him all together and so wildly that they wounded one another in their fury to rend him into pieces the tattered body gushing blood from sixandfifty wounds was hurled from top to bottom of the stairs with a goldhilted daggerdarnleys in token of his participation in the deedstill sticking in his breast ruthven stood forward from the group his reeking poniard clutched in his right hand a grin distorting his ghastly vulturine face then he stalked back alone into the royal presence dragging his feet a little like a man who is weary he found the room much as he had left it save that the queen had sunk back to her seat on the settle and darnley was now standing over her whilst her people were still hemmed about by his own men without a by your leave he flung himself into a chair and called hoarsely for a

cup of wine marys white face frowned at him across the room you shall yet drink the wine that i shall pour you for this nights work my lord and for this insolence who gave you leave to sit before me he waved a hand as if to dismiss the matter it may have seemed to him frivolous to dwell upon such a trifle amid so much its no frae lack o respect your grace he growled but frae lack o strength i am ill and i should ha been abed but for what was here to do ah she looked at him with cold repugnance what have you done with davie he shrugged yet his eyes quailed before her own hell be out yonder he answered grimly evasive and he took the wine one of his followers proffered him go see she bade the countess and the countess setting the candlebranch upon the buffet went out none attempting to hinder her then with narrowed eyes the queen watched ruthven while he drank it will be for the sake of murray and his friends that you do this she said slowly tell me my lord what great kindness is there between murray and you that to save him from forfeiture you run the risk of being forfeited with him what i have done he said i have done for others and under a bond that shall hold me scatheless under a bond said she and now she looked up at darnley standing ever at her side and was the bond yours my lord mme he started back i know naught of it but as he moved she saw something else she leaned forward pointing to the empty sheath at his girdle where is your dagger my lord she asked him sharply my dagger ha how should i know but i shall know she threatened as if she were not virtually a prisoner in the hands of these violent men who had invaded her palace and dragged rizzio from her side i shall not rest until i know the countess came in white to the lips bearing in her eyes something of the horror she had beheld what is it mary asked her her voice suddenly hushed and faltering madamehe is dead murdered she announced the queen looked at her her face of marble then her voice came hushed and tense areyou sure myself i saw his body madame there was a long pause a low moan escaped the queen and her lovely eyes were filled with tears slowly these coursed down her cheeks something compelling in her grief hushed every voice and the craven husband at her side shivered as her glance fell upon him once more and is it so she said at length considering him she dried her eyes then farewell tears i must study revenge she rose as if with labour and standing clung a moment to the tables edge a moment she looked at ruthven who sat glooming there dagger in one hand and empty winecup in the other then her glance passed on and came to rest balefully on darnleys face you have had your will my lord she said but consider well what i now say consider and remember i shall never rest until i give you as sore a heart as i have presently that said she staggered forward the countess hastened to her and leaning upon her arm mary passed through the little door of the closet into her chamber that night the common bell was rung and edinburgh roused in alarm bothwell huntly atholl and others who were at holyrood when rizzio was murdered finding it impossible to go to the queens assistance and fearing to share the secretarys fatefor the palace was aswarm with the murderers menatarmshad escaped by one of the windows the alarm they spread in edinburgh brought the provost and townsmen in arms to the palace by torchlight demanding to see the queen and refusing to depart until darnley had shown himself and assured them that all was well with the queen and with himself and what time darnley gave them this reassurance from a window of her room mary herself stood pale and taut amid the brutal horde that on this alarm had violated the privacy of her chamber while the ruffianly red douglas flashed his dagger before her eyes swearing that if she made a sound they would cut her into collops when at last they withdrew and left her to herself they left her no illusions as to her true condition she was a prisoner in her own palace the anterooms and courts were thronged with the soldiers of morton and ruthven the palace itself was hemmed about and none might come or go save at the good pleasure of the murderers at last darnley grasped the authority he had coveted he dictated forthwith a proclamation which was read next morning at edinburgh market crosscommanding that the nobles who had assembled in edinburgh to compose the parliament that was to pass the bill of attainder should quit the city within three hours under pain of treason and forfeiture and meanwhile with poor rizzios last cry of justice still ringing in her ears mary sat alone in her chamber studying revenge as she had promised so that life be spared her justice she vowed should be donepunishment not only for that barbarous deed but for the very manner of the doing of it for all the insult to which she had been subjected for the monstrous violence done her feelings and her very person for the present detention and peril of which she was full conscious her anger was the more intense because she never permitted it to diffuse itself over the several offenders ruthven who had insulted her so grossly douglas who had offered her personal violence the laird of faudonside morton and all the others who held her now a helpless prisoner she

hew for no more than the instruments of darnley it was against darnley that all her rage was concentrated she recalled in those bitter hours all that she had suffered at his vile hands and swore that at whatever cost to herself he should yield a full atonement he sought her in the morning emboldened by the sovereign power he was usurping confident that now that he showed himself master of the situation she would not repine over what was done beyond recall but would submit to the inevitable be reconciled with him and grant him perforcesupported as he now was by the rebellious lordsthe crown matrimonial and the full kingly power he coveted but her reception of him broke that confidence into shards you have done me such a wrong she told him in a voice of cold hatred that neither the recollection of our early friendship nor all the hope you can give me of the future could ever make me forget it jamais jamais je noublierai she added and upon that she dismissed him so imperiously that he went at once she sought a way to deal with him groped blindly for it being as yet but half informed of what was taking place and whilst she groped the thing she sought was suddenly thrust into her land mary beaton one of the few attendants left her brought her word later that day that the earl of murray with rothes and some other of the exiled lords was in the palace the news brought revelation it flooded with light the tragic happening of the night before showed her how darnley was building himself a party in the state it did more than that she recalled the erstwhile mutual hatred and mistrust of murray and darnley and saw how it might serve her in this emergency instantly she summoned murray to her presence with the message that she welcomed his return yet despite that message he hardly expectedconsidering what lay between themthe reception that awaited him at her hands she rose to receive him her lovely eyes suffused with tears she embraced him kissed him and then nestling to him as if for comfort her cheek against his bearded face she allowed her tears to flow unchecked i am punished she sobbedoh i am punished had i kept you at home murray you would never have suffered men to entreat me as i have been entreated holding her to hint he could but pat her shoulder soothing her utterly taken aback and deeply moved too by this display of an affection for him that he had never hitherto suspected in her ah mon dieu jamie how welcome you are to one in my sorrow she continued it is the fault of others that you have been so long out of the country i but require of you that you be a good subject to me and you shall never find me other to you than you deserve and he shaken to the depths of his selfish soul by her tears her clinging caresses and her protestations of affection answered with an oath and a sob that no better or more loyal and devoted subject than himself could all scotland yield her and as for this killing of davie he ended vehemently i swear by my souls salvation that i have had no part in it nor any knowledge of it until my return i knowi know she moaned should i make you welcome else be my friend jamie be my friend he swore it readily for he was very greedy of power and saw the door of his return to it opening wider than he could have hoped then he spoke of darnley begging her to receive him and hear what he might have to say protesting that the king swore that he had not desired the murder and that the lords had carried the matter out of his hands and much beyond all that he had intended because it suited her deep purpose mary consented feigning to be persuaded she had realized that before she could deal with darnley and the rebel lords who held her a prisoner she must first win free from holyrood darnley came he was sullen now mindful of his recent treatment and in fearnotwithstanding murrays reassuranceof further similar rebuffs she announced herself ready to hear what he might have to say and she listened attentively while he spoke her elbow on the carved arm of her chair her chin in her hand when he had done she sat long in thought gazing out through the window at the grey march sky at length she turned and looked at him do you pretend my lord to regret for what has passed she challenged him you tempt me to hypocrisy he said yet i will be frank as at an easter shrift since that fellow davie fell into credit and familiarity with your majesty you no longer treated me nor entertained me after your wonted fashion nor would you ever bear me company save this davie were the third can i pretend then to regret that one who deprived me of what i prized most highly upon earth should have been removed i cannot yet i can and do proclaim my innocence of any part or share in the deed that has removed him she lowered her eyes an instant then raised them again to meet his own you had commerce with these traitor lords she reminded him it is by your decree that they are returned from exile what was your aim in this to win back the things of which this fellow davie had robbed me a share in the ruling and the crown matrimonial that was my right yet which you denied me that and no more i had not intended that davie should be slain i had not measured the depth of their hatred of that upstart knave you see

that i am frank with you aye and i believe you she lied slowly considering him as she spoke and he drew a breath of relief suspecting nothing of her deep guile and do you know why i believe you because you are a fool madame he cried she rose magnificently contemptuous must i prove it you say that the crown matrimonial which i denied you is to be conferred on you by these lawless men believing that you signed their pardon and recall from exile ha you do not see my lord that you are no more than their tool their catspaw you do not see that they use you but for their ends and that when they have done with you they will serve you as they served poor davie no you see none of that which is why i call you a fool that need a womans wit to open wide your eyes she was so vehement that she forced upon his dull wits some of the convictions she pretended were her own yet resisting those convictions he cried out that she was at fault at fault she laughed let my memory inform your judgment when these lords with murray at their head protested against our marriage in what terms did they frame their protest they complained that i had set over them without consulting them one who had no title to it whether by lineal descent of blood by nature or by consent of the estates consider that they added rememberi repeat to you the very words they wrote and publishedthat while they deemed it their duty to endure under me they deemed it intolerable to suffer under you she was flushed and her eyes gleamed with excitement she clutched his sleeve and brought her face close to his own looked deep and compellingly into his eyes as she continued such was their proclamation and they took arms against me to enforce it to pull you down from the place to which i had raised you out of the dust yet you can forget it and in your purblind folly turn to these very men to right the wrongs you fancy i have done you do you think that men holding you in such esteem as that can keep any sort of faith with you do you think these are the men who are likely to fortify and maintain your title to the crown ask yourself and answer for yourself he was white to the lips as much by her vehement pretence of sincerity as by the apparently irrefragable logic of her arguments she forced conviction upon him this brought a loathly fear in its train and the gates of his heart stood ever wide to fear he stepped aside to a chair and sank into it looking at her with dilating eyesa fool confronted with the likely fruits of his folly thenthenwhy did they proffer me their help how can they achieve their ends this way how do you still ask do you not see what a blind tool you have been in their crafty hands in name at least you are king and your signature is binding upon my subjects have you not brought them back from exile by one royal decree whilst by another you have dispersed the parliament that was assembled to attaint them of treason she stepped close up to him and bending over him as he sat there crushed by realization she lowered her voice pray god my lord that all their purpose with you is not yet complete else in their hands i do not think your life is to be valued at an appleparing you go the ways poor davie went he sank his handsome head to his hands and covered his face a while he sat huddled there she watching him with gleaming crafty eyes at length he rallied he looked up tossing back the auburn hair from his white brow still fighting though weakly against persuasion it is not possible he cried they could not they could not she laughed betwixt bitterness and sadness trust to that she bade him yet look well at matters as they are already i am a prisoner here in these mens hands they will not let me go until their full purpose is accomplishedperhaps she added wistfully perhaps not even then ah not that he cried out even that she answered firmly but and again she grew vehement is it less so with you are you less a prisoner than i dye think you will be suffered to come and go at will she saw the increase of fear in him and then she struck boldly setting all upon the gamble of a guess i am kept here until i shall have been brought to such a state that i will add my signature to your own and so pardon one and all for what is done his sudden start the sudden quickening of his glance told her how shrewdly she had struck home fearlessly then sure of herself she continued to that end they use you when you shall have served it you will but cumber them when they shall have used you to procure their security from me then they will deal with you as they have ever sought to deal with youso that you trouble them no more ali at last you understand he came to his feet his brow gleaming with sweat his slender hands nervously interlocked oh god he cried in a stifled voice aye you are in a trap my lord yourself youve sprung it and now you behold him broken by the terror she had so cunningly evoked he flung himself upon his knees before her and with upturned face and hands that caught and clawed at her own he implored her pardon for the wrong that in his folly he had done her in taking sides with her enemies she dissembled under

a mask of gentleness the loathing that his cowardice aroused in her my enemies she echoed wistfully say rather your own enemies it was their enmity to you that drove them into exile in your rashness you have recalled them whilst at the same time you have so bound my hands that i cannot now help you if i would you can mary he cried or else no one can withhold the pardon they will presently be seeking of you refuse to sign any remission of their deed and leave them to force you to sign it and so destroy us both she answered he ranted then invoking the saints of heaven and imploring her in their nameshe who was so wise and strongto discover some way out of this tangle in which his madness had enmeshed them what way is there short of flight she asked him and how are we to fly who are imprisoned here you as well as myself alas darnley i fear our lives will end by paying the price of your folly thus she played upon his terrors so that he would not be dismissed until she had promised that she would consider and seek some means of saving him enjoining him meanwhile to keep strict watch upon himself and see that he betrayed nothing of his thoughts she left him to the chastening of a sleepless night then sent for him betimes on monday morning and bade him repair to the lords and tell them that realizing herself a prisoner in their hands she was disposed to make terms with them she would grant them pardon for what was done if on their side they undertook to be loyal henceforth and allowed her to resume her liberty the message startled him but the smile with which she followed it was reassuring there is something else you are to do she said if we are to turn the tables on these traitorous gentlemen listen and she added matter that begat fresh hope in darnleys despairing soul he kissed her hands lowly now and obedient as a hound that had been whipped to heel and went below to bear her message to the lords morton and ruthven heard him out but betrayed no eagerness to seize the opportunity all this is but words that we hear growled ruthven who lay stretched upon a couch grimly suffering from the disease that was slowly eating up his life she is guileful as the serpent morton added being bred up in the court of france she will make you follow her will and desire but she will not so lead us we hold her fast and we do not let her go without some good security of what shall follow what security will satisfy you quoth darnley murray and lindsay came in as he was speaking and morton told them of the message that darnley had brought murray moved heavily across to a windowseat and sat down he cleared a windowpane with his hand and looked out upon the wintry landscape as if the matter had no interest for him but lindsay echoed what the other twain had said already we want a deal more than promises that need not be kept he said darnley looked from one to the other of them seeing in their uncompromising attitude a confirmation of what the queen had told him and noting tooas at another time he might not have notedtheir utter lack of deference to himself their king sirs he said i vow you wrong her majesty i will stake my life upon her honour why so you may sneered ruthven but youll not stake ours take what security you please and i will subscribe it aye but will the queen wondered morton she will i have her word for it it took them the whole of that day to consider the terms of the articles that would satisfy them towards evening the document was ready and morton and ruthven representing all accompanied by murray and introduced by darnley came to the chamber to which her majesty was confined by the guard they had set upon her she sat as if in state awaiting them very lovely and very tearful knowing that womans greatest strength is in her weakness that tears would serve her best by presenting her as if broken to their will in outward submission they knelt before her to make the pretence of suing for the pardon which they extorted by force of arms and duress when each in his turn had made the brief pleading oration he had prepared she dried her eyes and controlled herself by obvious effort my lords she said in a voice that quivered and broke on every other word when have ye ever found me bloodthirsty or greedy of your lands or goods that you must use me so and take such means with me ye have set my authority at naught and wrought sedition in this realm yet i forgive you all that by this clemency i may move you to a better love and loyalty i desire that all that is passed may be buried in oblivion so that you swear to me that in the future you will stand my friends and serve me faithfully who am but a weak woman and sorely need stout men to be my friends for a moment her utterance was checked by sobs then she controlled herself again by an effort so piteous to behold that even the flintyhearted ruthven was moved to some compassion forgive this weakness in me who am very weak for very soon i am to be brought to bed as you well know and i am in no case to offer resistance to any i have no more to say my lords since you promise on your side that you will put all disloyalty behind you i pledge myself to remit and pardon all those that were
Document 66
banished for their share in the late rising and likewise to pardon those that were concerned in the killing of seigneur davie all this shall be as if it had never been i pray you my lords make your own security in what sort you best please and i will subscribe it morton proffered her the document they had prepared she conned it slowly what time they watched her pausing ever and anon to brush aside the tears that blurred her vision at last she nodded her lovely golden head it is very well she said all is here as i would have it be between us and she turned to darnley give me pen and ink my lord darnley dipped a quill and handed it to her she set the parchment on the little pulpit at her side then as she bent to sign the pen fluttered from her fingers and with a deep shuddering sigh she sank back in her chair her eyes closed her face piteously white the queen is faint cried murray springing forward but she rallied instantly smiling upon them wanly it is naught it is past she said but even as she spoke she put a hand to her brow i am something dizzy my condition she faltered on a trembling note of appeal that increased their compassion and aroused in them a shame of their own harshness leave this security with me i will subscribe it in the morningindeed as soon as i am sufficiently recovered they rose from their knees at her bidding and morton in the name of all professed himself full satisfied and deplored the affliction they had caused her for which in the future they should make her their amends i thank you she answered simply you have leave to go they departed well satisfied and counting the matter at an end they quitted the palace and rode to their various lodgings in edinburgh town murray going with morton anon to maitland of lethington who had remained behind came one of the queens women to summon him to her presence he found her disposing herself for bed and was received by her with tearful upbraidings sir she said one of the conditions upon which i consented to the will of their lordships was that an immediate term should be set to the insulting state of imprisonment in which i am kept here yet menatarms still guard the very door of my chamber and my very attendants are hindered in their comings and goings do you call this keeping faith with me have i not granted all the requests of the lords lethington perceiving the justice of what she urged withdrew shamed and confused at once to remedy the matter by removing the guards from the passage and the stairs and elsewhere leaving none but those who paced outside the palace it was a rashness he was bitterly to repent him on the morrow when it was discovered that in the night mary had not only escaped but had taken darnley with her accompanied by him and a few attendants she had executed the plan in which earlier that day she had secured her scared husbands cooperation at midnight they had made their way along the now unguarded corridors and descended to the vaults of the palace whence a secret passage communicated with the chapel through this and across the graveyard where lay the newly buried body of the siegneur daviealmost across the very grave itself which stood near the chapel door they had won to the horses waiting by darnleys orders in the open and they had ridden so hard that by five oclock of that tuesday morning they were in dunbar in vain did the alarmed lords send a message after her to demand her signature of the security upon which she had duped them into counting prematurely within a week they were in full flight before the army at the head of which the prisoner who had slipped through their hands was returning to destroy them too late did they perceive the arts by which she had fooled them and seduced the shallow darnley to betray them ii the night of kirk o fieldthe murder of darnley perhaps one of the greatest mistakes of a lifetime in which mistakes were plentiful was the hesitancy of the queen of scots in executing upon her husband darnley the prompt vengeance she had sworn for the murder of david rizzio when rizzio was slain and she herself held captive by the murderers in her palace of holyrood whilst darnley ruled as king she had simulated belief in her husbands innocence that she might use him for her vengeful ends she had played so craftily upon his cowardly nature as to convince him that morton ruthven and the other traitor lords with whom he had leagued himself were at heart his own implacable enemies that they pretended friendship for him to make a tool of him and that when he had served their turn they would destroy him in his consequent terror he had betrayed his associates assisting her to trick them by a promise to sign an act of oblivion for what was done trusting to this the lords had relaxed their vigilance whereupon accompanied by darnley she had escaped by night from holyrood hope tempering at first the rage and chagrin in the hearts of the lords she had duped they had sent a messenger to her at dunbar to request of her the fulfilment of her promise to sign the document of their security but mary put off the messenger and whilst the army she had summoned was hastily assembling she used her craft to divide the rebels against themselves to her natural brother the earl of murray to argyll and to all those who had been exiled for their rebellion at the time of her marriageand who knew not where they stood in the present turn of
Document 67
events since one of the objects of the murder had been to procure their reinstatementshe sent an offer of complete pardon on condition that they should at once dissociate themselves from those concerned in the death of the seigneur davie these terms they accepted thankfully as well they might thereupon finding themselves abandoned by all meneven by darnley in whose service they had engaged in the murdermorton ruthven and their associates scattered and fled by the end of that month of march morton ruthven lindsay of the byres george douglas and some sixty others were denounced as rebels with forfeiture of life and goods while one thomas scott who had been in command of the guards that had kept her majesty prisoner at holyrood was hanged drawn and quartered at the market cross news of this reached the fugitives to increase their desperate rage but what drove the iron into the soul of the archmurderer ruthven was darnleys solemn public declaration denying all knowledge of or complicity in rizzios assassination nor did it soothe his fury to know that all scotland rang with contemptuous laughter at that impudent and cowardly perjury from his sickbed at newcastle whereon some six weeks later he was to breathe his last the forsaken wretch replied to it by sending the queen the bond to which he had demanded darnleys signature before embarking upon the business it was a damning document there above the plain signature and seal of the king was the admission not merely of complicity but that the thing was done by his express will and command that the responsibility was his own and that he would hold the doers scatheless from all consequences mary could scarcely have hoped to be able to confront her worthless husband with so complete a proof of his duplicity and baseness she sent for him confounded him with the sight of that appalling bond made an end to the amity which for her own ends she had pretended and drove him out of her presence with a fury before which he dared not linger you see him then crushed under his load of mortification realizing at last how he had been duped on every hand first by the lords for their own purpose and then by the queen for hers her contempt of him was now so manifest that it spread to all who served himfor she made it plain that who showed him friendship earned her deep displeasureso that he was forced to withdraw from a court where his life was become impossible for a while he wandered up and down a land where every door was shut in his face where every man of whatsoever party traitor or true despised him alike in the end he took himself off to his father lennox and at glasgow he sought what amusement he could with his dogs and his hawks and such odd vulgar rustic loveaffairs as came his way it was in allowing him thus to go his ways in leaving her vengeanceindeed her justicebut half accomplished that lay the greatest of the queens mistakes better for her had she taken with darnley the direct way that was her right better for her if acting strongly then she had banished or hanged him for his part in the treason that had inspired the murder of rizzio unfortunately a factor that served to quicken her abhorrence of him served also to set a curb of caution upon the satisfaction of it this factor that came so inopportunely into her life was her regard for the arrogant unscrupulous earl of bothwell her hand was stayed by fear that men should say that for bothwells sake she had rid herself of a husband become troublesome that bothwell had been her friend in the hour when she had needed friends and knew not whom she might trust that by his masterfulness he seemed a man upon whom a woman might lean with confidence may account for the beginnings of the extraordinary influence he came so swiftly to exercise over her and the passion he awakened in her to such a degree that she was unable to dissemble it her regard for him the more flagrant by contrast with her contempt for darnley is betrayed in the will she made before her confinement in the following june whilst to darnley she bequeathed nothing but the redenamelled diamond ring with which he had married herit was with this that i was married she wrote almost contemptuously i leave it to the king who gave it meshe appointed bothwell to the tutelage of her child in the event of her not surviving it and to the government of the realm the king came to visit her during her convalescence and was scowled upon by murray and argyll who were at holyrood and most of all by bothwell whose arrogance by now was such that he was become the besthated man in scotland the queen received him very coldly whilst using bothwell more than cordially in his very presence so that he departed again in a deeper humiliation than before then before the end of july there was her sudden visit to bothwell at alloa which gave rise to so much scandal hearing of it darnley followed in a vain attempt to assert his rights as king and husband only to be flouted and dismissed with the conviction that his life was no longer safe in scotland and that he had best cross the border yet to his undoing detained perhaps by the overweening pride that is usually part of a fools equipment he did not act upon that wise resolve he returned instead to his hawking and his hunting and was seldom seen at court thereafter even when in the following october mary lay at the point of death at jedburgh darnley came but to stay a day and left her again without any assurance that she would recover but then the

facts of her illness and how it had been contracted were not such as to encourage kindness in him even had he been inclined to kindness bothwell had taken three wounds in a border affray some weeks before and mary hearing of this and that he lay in grievous case at hermitage had ridden thither in her fond solicitudea distance of thirty milesand back again in the same day thus contracting a chill which had brought her to the very gates of death darnley had not only heard of this but he had found bothwell at jedburgh whither he had been borne in a litter when in his turn he had heard of how it was with mary and bothwell had treated him with more than the contempt which all men now showed him but which from none could wound him so deeply as from this man whom rumour accounted marys lover matters between husband and wife were thus come to a pass in which they could not continue as all men saw and as she herself confessed at craigrnillar whither she repaired still weak in body towards the end of november over a great fire that blazed in a vast chamber of the castle she sat sick at heart and shivering for all that her wasted body was swathed in a long cloak of deepest purple reversed with ermine her face was thin and of a transparent pallor her eyes great pools of wistfulness amid the shadows which her illness had set about them i do wish i could be dead she sighed bothwells eyes narrowed he was leaning on the back of her tall chair a long virile figure with a hawknosed bearded face that was sternly handsome he thrust back the crisp dark hair that clustered about his brow and fetched a sigh it was never my own death i wished when a man stood in my road to aught i craved he said lowering his voice for maitland of lethingtonnow restored to his secretaryshipwas writing at a table across the room and my lord of argyll was leaning over him she looked up at him suddenly her eyes startled what devils counsel do you whisper she asked him and when he would have answered she raised a hand no she said not that way there is another said bothwell coolly he moved came round and stood squarely upon the hearth his back to the fire confronting her nor did he further trouble to lower his voice we have considered it already what have you considered her voice was strained fear and excitement blended in her face how the shackles that fetter you might be broken be not alarmed it was the virtuous murray himself propounded it to argyll and lethingtonfor the good of scotland and yourself a sneer flitted across his tanned face let them speak for themselves he raised his voice and called to them across the room they came at once and the four made an odd group as they stood there in the firelit gloom of that november daythe lovely young queen so frail and wistful in her highbacked chair the stalwart arrogant bothwell magnificent in a doublet of peachcoloured velvet that tapered to a golden girdle argyll portly and sober in a rich suit of black and maitland of lethington lean and crafty of face in a long furred gown that flapped about his bony shanks it was to lethington that bothwell addressed himself her grace is in a mood to hear how the gordian knot of her marriage might be unravelled said he grimly ironic lethington raised his eyebrows licked his thin lips and rubbed his bony hands one in the other unravelled he echoed with wondering stress unravelled ha his dark eyes flashed round at them better adopt alexanders plan and cut it twill be more complete andand final no no she cried i will not have you shed his blood he himself was none so tender where another was concerned bothwell reminded heras if the memory of rizzio were dear to him what he may have done does not weigh upon my conscience was her answer he might put in argyll be convicted of treason for having consented to your graces retention in ward at holyrood after rizzios murder she considered an instant then shook her head it is too late it should have been done long since now men will say that it is but a pretext to be rid of him she looked up at bothwell who remained standing immediately before her between her and the fire you said that my lord of murray had discussed this matter was it in such terms as these bothwell laughed silently at the thought of the sly murray rendering himself a party to anything so direct and desperate it was lethington who answered her my lord murray was for a divorce that would set your grace free and it might be obtained he said by tearing up the popes bull of dispensation that permitted the marriage yet madame although lord murray would himself go no further i have no cause to doubt that were other means concerted he would be content to look through his fingers her mind however did not seem to follow his speech beyond the matter of the divorce a faint flush of eagerness stirred in her pale cheeks ah yes she cried i too have thought of thatof this divorce and god knows i do not want for grounds and it could be obtained you say by tearing up this papal bull the marriage could be proclaimed void thereafter argyll explained she looked past bothwell into the fire and took her chin in her hand yes she said slowly musingly and again yes that were a way that is the way and then suddenly she looked up and they saw doubt and dread in her eyes but in that casewhat of my son aye said lethington

grimly he shrugged his narrow shoulders parted his hands and brought them together again thats the obstacle as we perceived it would imperil his succession it would make a bastard of him you mean she cried demanding the full expansion of their thoughts indeed it would do no less the secretary assented so that said bothwell softly we come back to alexanders method what the fingers may not unravel the knife can sever she shivered and drew her furred cloak the more closely about her lethington leaned forward he spoke in kindly soothing accents let us guide this matter among us madame he murmured and well find means to rid your grace of this young fool without hurt to your honour or prejudice to your son and the earl of murray will look the other way provided you pardon morton and his friends for the killing they did in darnleys service she looked from one to the other of them scanning each face in turn then her eyes returned to a contemplation of the flaming logs and she spoke very softly do nothing by which a spot might be laid on my honour or conscience she said with an odd deliberateness that seemed to insist upon the strictly literal meaning of her words rather i pray you let the matter rest until god remedy it lethington looked at the other two the other two looked at him he rubbed his hands softly trust to us madame he answered we will so guide the matter that your grace shall see nothing but what is good and approved by parliament she committed herself to no reply and so they were content to take their answer from her silence they went in quest of huntly and sir james balfour and the five of them entered into a bond for the destruction of him whom they named the young fool and proud tiranne to be engaged in when mary should have pardoned morton and his fellowconspirators it was not until christmas eve that she signed this pardon of some seventy fugitives proscribed for their participation in the rizzio murder towards whom she had hitherto shown herself so implacable the world saw in this no more than a deed of clemency and charity befitting the solemn festival of goodwill but the five who had entered into that bond at craigmillar castle beheld in it more accurately the fulfilment of her part of the suggested bargain the price she paid in advance to be rid of darnley the sign of her full agreement that the knot which might not be unravelled should be cut on that same day her grace went with bothwell to lord drummonds where they abode for the best part of a week and thence they went on together to tullibardine the rash and open intimacy between them giving nourishment to scandal at the same time darnley quitted stirling where he had lately been living in miserable conditions ignored by the nobles and even stinted in his necessary expenses deprived of his ordinary servants and his silver replaced by pewter the miserable youth reached glasgow deadly sick he had been taken ill on the way and the inevitable rumour was spread that he had been poisoned later when it became known that his once lovely countenance was now blotched and disfigured it was realized that his illness was no more than the inevitable result of the debauched life he led conceiving himself on the point of death darnley wrote piteously to the queen but she ignored his letters until she learnt that his condition was improving when at last on january th she went to visit him at glasgow it may well be that she nourished some hope that nature would resolve the matter for her and remove the need for such desperate measures as had been concerted but seeing him likely to recover two things became necessary to bring him to the place that was suitable for the fulfilment of her designs and to simulate reconciliation with him and even renewed and tender affection so that none might hereafter charge her with complicity in what should follow i hope that in this i do her memory no injustice it is thus that i read the sequel nor can i read it in any other way she found him abed with a piece of taffeta over his face to hide its disfigurement and she was so movedas it seemedby his condition that she fell on her knees beside him and wept in the presence of her attendants and his own confessing penitence if anything she had done in the past could have contributed to their estrangement thus reconciliation followed and she used him tenderly grew solicitous concerning him and vowed that as soon as he could be moved he must be taken to surroundings more salubrious and more befitting the dignity of his station gladly then he agreed to return with her to holyrood not to holyrood she said at least not until your health is mended lest you should carry thither infection dangerous to your little son whither then he asked her and when she mentioned craigmillar he started up in bed so that the taffeta slipped from his face and it was with difficulty that she dissembled the loathing with which the sight of its pustules inspired her craigmillar he cried then what i was told is true what were you told quoth she staring at him brows knit her face blank a rumour had filtered through to him of the craigmillar bond he had been told that a letter drawn up there had been presented to her for her signature which she had refused thus much he told her adding that he could not believe that she would do him any hurt and yet why did she desire to bear him to craigmillar you have been told lies she answered him i saw no such letter i subscribed none nor
Document 70
was ever asked to subscribe any which indeed was literally true to this i swear as for your going to craigmillar you shall go whithersoever you please yourself he sank back on his pillows and his trembling subsided i believe thee mary i believe thould never do me any harm he repeated and if any other would he added on a bombastic note they shall buy it dear unless they take me sleeping but ill never to craigmillar i have said you shall go where you please she assured him again he considered there is the house at kirk o field it has a fine garden and is in a position that is deemed the healthiest about edinburgh i need good air good air and baths have been prescribed me to cleanse me of this plague kirk o field will serve if it be your pleasure she gave a ready consent dispatched messengers ahead to prepare the house and to take from holyrood certain furnishings that should improve the interior and render it as fitting as possible a dwelling for a king some days later they set out his misgivings quieted by the tenderness which she now showed himparticularly when witnesses were at hand it was a tenderness that grew steadily during those twelve days in which he lay in convalescence in the house at kirk o field she was playful and coquettish with him as a maid with her lover so that nothing was talked of but the completeness of this reconciliation and the hope that it would lead to a peace within the realm that would be a benefit to all yet many there were who marvelled at it wondering whether the waywardness and caprice of woman could account for so sudden a change from hatred to affection darnley was lodged on the upper floor in a room comfortably furnished from the palace it was hung with six pieces of tapestry and the floor was partly covered by an eastern carpet it contained besides the handsome bedwhich once had belonged to the queens mothera couple of high chairs in purple velvet a little table with a green velvet cover and some cushions in red by the side of the bed stood the specially prepared bath that was part of the cure which darnley was undergoing it had for its incongruous lid a door that had been lifted from its hinges immediately underneath was a room that had been prepared for the queen with a little bed of yellow and green damask and a furred coverlet the windows looked out upon the close and the door opened upon the passage leading to the garden here the queen slept on several of those nights of early february for indeed she was more often at kirk o field than at holyrood and when she was not bearing darnley company in his chamber and beguiling the tedium of his illness she was to be seen walking in the garden with lady reres and from his bed he could hear her sometimes singing as she sauntered there never since the ephemeral season of their courtship had she been on such fond terms with him and all his fears of hostile designs entertained against him by her immediate followers were stilled at last yet not for long into his fools paradise came lord robert of holyrood with a warning that flung him into a sweat of panic the conspirators had hired a few trusted assistants to help them carry out their plans and a rumour had got abroadin the unaccountable way of rumoursthat there was danger to the king it was of this rumour that lord robert brought him word telling him bluntly that unless he escaped quickly from this place he would leave his life there yet when darnley had repeated this to the queen and the queen indignantly had sent for lord robert and demanded to know his meaning his lordship denied that he had uttered any such warning protested that his words must have been misunderstoodthat they referred solely to the kings condition which demanded he thought different treatment and healthier air knowing not what to believe darnleys uneasiness abode with him yet trusting mary and feeling secure so long as she was by his side he became more and more insistent upon her presence more and more fretful in her absence it was to quiet him that she consented to sleep as often as might be at kirk o field she slept there on the wednesday of that week and again on friday and she was to have done so yet again on that fateful sunday february th but that her servant sebastienone who had accompanied her from france and for whom she had a deep affectionwas that day married and her majesty had promised to be present at the masque that night at holyrood in honour of his nuptials nevertheless she did not utterly neglect her husband on that account she rode to kirk o field early in the evening accompanied by bothwell huntly argyll and some others and leaving the lords at cards below to while away the time she repaired to darnley and sat beside his bed soothing a spirit oddly perturbed as if with some premonition of what was brewing yell not leave me the night he begged her once alas she said i must sebastien is being wed and i have promised to be present he sighed and shifted uneasily soon i shall be well and then these foolish humours will cease to haunt me but just now i cannot bear you from my sight when you are with me i am at peace i know that all is well but when you go i am filled with fears lying helpless here what should you fear she asked him the hate that i know is alive against me you are casting shadows to affright yourself said she whats that he cried half raising himself in

sudden alarm listen from the room below came faintly a sound of footsteps accompanied by a noise as of something being trundled it will be my servants in my roomputting it to rights to what purpose since you do not sleep there tonight he asked he raised his voice and called his page why what will you do she asked him steadying her own alarm he answered her by bidding the youth who had entered go see what was doing in the room below the lad departed and had he done his errand faithfully he would have found bothwells followers hay and hepburn and the queens man nicholas hubert better known as french parisemptying a keg of gunpowder on the floor immediately under the kings bed but it happened that in the passage he came suddenly face to face with the splendid figure of bothwell cloaked and hatted and bothwell asked him whither he went the boy told him it is nothing bothwell said they are moving her graces bed in accordance with her wishes and the lad overborne by that commanding figure which so effectively blocked his path chose the line of lesser resistance he went back to bear the king that message as if for himself he had seen what my lord bothwell had but told him darnley was pacified by the assurance and the lad withdrew did i not tell you how it was quoth mary is not my word enough forgive the doubt darnley begged her indeed there was no doubt of you who have shown me so much charity in my affliction he sighed and looked at her with melancholy eyes i would the past had been other than it has been between you and me he said i was too young for kingship i think in my green youth i listened to false counsellors and was quick to jealousy and the follies it begets then when you cast me out and i wandered friendless a devil took possession of me yet if you will but consent to bury all the past into oblivion i will make amends and you shall find me worthier hereafter she rose white to the lips her bosom heaving under her long cloak she turned aside and stepped to the window she stood there peering out into the gloom of the close her knees trembling under her why do you not answer me he cried what answer do you need she said and her voice shook are you not answered already and then breathlessly she added it is time to go i think they heard a heavy step upon the stairs and the clank of a sword against the rails the door opened and bothwell wrapped in his scarlet cloak stood bending his tall shoulders under the low lintel his gleaming eyes so oddly mocking in their glance for all that his face was set fell upon darnley and with their look flung him into an inward state of blending fear and rage your grace said bothwells deep voice it is close upon midnight he came no more than in time it needed the sight of him with its reminder of all that he meant to her to sustain a purpose that was being sapped by pity very well she said i come bothwell stood aside to give her egress and to invite it but the king delayed her a momenta word he begged and to bothwell give us leave apart sir yet king though he might be there was no ready obedience from the arrogant border lord her lover it was to mary that bothwell looked for commands nor stirred until she signed to him to go and even then he went no farther than the other side of the door so that he might be close at hand to fortify her should any weakness assail her now in this supreme hour darnley struggled up in bed caught her hand and pulled her to him do not leave me mary do not leave me he implored her why what is this she cried but her voice lacked steadiness would you have me disappoint poor sebastien who loves me i see sebastien is more to you than i now this is folly sebastien is my faithful servant and am i less do you not believe that my one aim henceforth will be to serve you and faithfully oh forgive this weakness i am full of evil foreboding tonight go then if go you must but give me at least some assurance of your love some pledge of it in earnest that you will come again tomorrow nor part from me again she looked into the white piteous young face that had once been so lovely and her soul faltered it needed the knowledge that bothwell waited just beyond the door that he could overhear what was being said to strengthen her fearfully in her tragic purpose she has been censured most for what next she did murray himself spoke of it afterwards as the worst part of the business but it is possible that she was concerned only at the moment to put an end to a scene that was unnerving her and that she took the readiest means to it she drew a ring from her finger and slipped it on to one of his be this the pledge then she said and so content and rest yourself with that she broke from him white and scared and reached the door yet with her hand upon the latch she paused looking at him she saw that he was smiling and perhaps horror of her betrayal of him overwhelmed her it must be that she then desired to warn him yet with bothwell within earshot she realized that any warning must precipitate the tragedy with direst consequences to bothwell and herself to conquer her weakness she thought of david rizzio whom darnley had murdered almost at her feet and whom

this night was to avenge she thought of the judas part that he had played in that affair and sought persuasion that it was fitting he should now be paid in kind yet very woman that she was failing to find any such persuasion she found instead in the very thought of rizzio the very means to convey her warning standing tense and white by the door regarding him with dilating eyes she spoke her last words to him it would be just about this time last year that davie was slain she said and on that passed out to the waiting bothwell once on the stairs she paused and set a hand upon the shoulder of the stalwart borderer must it be oh must it be she whispered fearfully she caught the flash of his eyes in the half gloom as he leaned over her his arm about her waist drawing her to him is it not just is it not full merited he asked her and yet i would that we did not profit by it she complained shall we pity him on that account he asked and laughed softly and shortly come away he added abruptly they wait for you and so by the suasion of his arm and his imperious will she was swept onward along the road of her destiny outside the horses were ready there was a little group of gentlemen to escort her and half a dozen servants with lighted torches whilst lady reres was in waiting a man stood forward to assist her to mount his face and hands so blackened by gunpowder that for a moment she failed to recognize him she laughed nervously when he named himself lord paris how begrimed you are she cried and mounting rode away towards holyrood with her torchbearers and attendants in the room above darnley lay considering her last words he turned them over in his thoughts assured by the tone she had used and how she had looked that they contained some message it would be just about this time last year that davie was slain in themselves those words were not strictly accurate it wanted yet a month to the anniversary of rizzios death and why at parting should she have reminded him of that which she had agreed should be forgotten instantly came the answer that she sought to warn him that retribution was impending he thought again of the rumours that he had heard of a bond signed at craigmillar he recalled lord roberts warning to him afterwards denied he recalled her words to himself at the time of rizzios death consider well what i now say consider and remember i shall never rest until i give you as sore a heart as i have presently and further he remembered her cry at once agonized and fiercely vengeful jamais jamais je noublierai his terrors mounted swiftly to be quieted again at last when he looked at the ring she had put upon his finger in pledge of her renewed affection the past was dead and buried surely though danger might threaten she would guard him against it setting her love about him like a panoply of steel when she came tomorrow he would question her closely and she should be more frank and open with him and tell him all meanwhile he would take his precautions for tonight he sent his page to make fast all doors the youth went and did as he was bidden with the exception of the door that led to the garden it had no bolts and the key was missing yet seeing his masters nervous excited state he forbore from any mention of that circumstance when presently he returned to him darnley requested a book of psalms that he might read himself to sleep the page dozed in a chair and so the hours passed and at last the king himself fell into a light slumber out of this he started suddenly at a little before two oclock and sat upright in bed alarmed without knowing why listening with straining ears and throbbing pulses he caught a repetition of the sound that had aroused him a sound akin to that which had drawn his attention earlier when mary had been with him it came up faintly from the room immediately beneath her room some one was moving there he thought then as he continued to listen all became quiet again save his fears which would not be quieted he extinguished the light slipped from the bed and crossing to the window peered out into the close that was faintly illumined by a moon in its first quarter a shadow moved he thought he watched with increasing panic for confirmation and presently saw that he had been right not one but several shadows were shifting there among the trees shadows of men they were and as he peered he saw one that went running from the house across the lawn and joined the others now clustered together in a group what could be their purpose here in the silence he seemed to hear again the echo of marys last words to him it would be just about this time last year that davie was slain in terror he groped his way to the chair where the page slept and shook the lad vigorously afoot boy he said in a hoarse whisper he had meant to shout it but his voice failed him his windpipe clutched by panic afootwe are beset by enemies at once the youth was wide awake and together the king just in his shirt as he wasthey made their way from the room in the dark groping their way and so reached the windows at the back darnley opened one of these very softly then sent the boy back for a sheet making this fast they descended by it to the garden and started towards the wall intending to climb it that

they might reach the open the boy led the way and the king followed his teeth chattering as much from the cold as from the terror that possessed him and then quite suddenly without the least warning the ground it seemed to them heaved under their feet and they were flung violently forward on their faces a great blaze rent the darkness of the night accompanied by the thunders of an explosion so terrific that it seemed as if the whole world must have been shattered by it for some instants the king and his page lay half stunned where they had fallen and well might it have been for them had they so continued but darnley recovering staggered to his feet pulling the boy up with him and supporting him then as he began to move he heard a soft whistle in the gloom behind him over his shoulder he looked towards the house to behold a great smoking gap now yawning in it through this gap he caught a glimpse of shadowy men moving in the close beyond and he realized that he had been seen the white shirt he wore had betrayed his presence to them with a stifled scream he began to run towards the wall the page staggering after him behind them now came the clank and thud of a score of overtaking feet soon they were surrounded the king turned this way and that desperately seeking a way out of the murderous human ring that fenced them round what dye seek what dye seek he screeched in a pitiful attempt to question with authority a tall man in a trailing cloak advanced and seized him we seek thee fool said the voice of bothwell the kingliness that he had never known how to wear becomingly now fell from him utterly mercymercy he cried such mercy as you had on david rizzio answered the border lord darnley fell on his knees and sought to embrace the murderers legs bothwell stooped over him seized the wretched mans shirt and pulled it from his shivering body then flinging the sleeves about the royal neck slipped one over the other and drew them tight nor relaxed his hold until the young mans struggles had entirely ceased four days later mary went to visit the body of her husband in the chapel of holyrood house whither it had been conveyed and there as a contemporary tells us she looked upon it long not only without grief but with greedy eyes thereafter it was buried secretly in the night by rizzios side so that murderer and victim lay at peace together in the end iii the night of betrayalantonio perez and philip ii of spain you a spaniard of spain had been her taunt dry and contemptuous i do not believe it and upon that she had put spur to the great black horse that bore her and had ridden off along the precipitous road by the river after her he had flung his answer on a note of laughter bitter and cynical as the laughter of the damned laughter that expressed all things but mirth oh a spaniard of spain indeed madame la marquise very much a spaniard of spain i assure you the great black horse and the woman in red flashed round a bend of the rocky road and were eclipsed by a clump of larches the man leaned heavily upon his ebony cane sighed wearily and grew thoughtful then with a laugh and a shrug he sat down in the shade of the firs that bordered the road behind him crowning the heights loomed the brown castle built by gaston phoebus count of foix two hundred years ago and the tower of montauzet its walls scarred by the shots of the rebellious biscayans below him nourished by the snows that were dissolving under the sunshine of early spring sped the tumbling river beyond this spread pasture and arable land to the distant hills and beyond those stood the gigantic sharpsummited wall of the pyrenees its long ridge dominated by the cloven cone of the snow clad pic du midi there was in the sight of that great barrier at once natural and political a sense of security for this fugitive from the perils and the hatreds that lurked in spain beyond here in bearn he was a kings guest enjoying the hospitality of the great castle of pau safe from the vindictive persecution of the mean tyrant who ruled in spain and here at last he was at peace or would have been but for the thought of this womanthis marquise de chantenacwho had gone to such lengths in her endeavours to soften his exile that her ultimate object could never have been in doubt to a coxcomb though it was in some doubt to antonio perez who had been cured for all time of coxcombry by suffering and misfortune to say nothing of increasing age it was when he bethought him of that age of his that he was chiefly intrigued by the amazing ardour of this great lady of bearn a dozen years agobefore misfortune overtook himhe would have accepted her flagrant wooing as a proper tribute for then he had been the handsome wealthy witty profligate secretary of state to his catholic majesty king philip ii with a power in spain second only to the kings and sometimes even greater in those days he would have welcomed her as her endowments merited she was radiantly lovely in the very noontide of her resplendent youth the wellborn widow of a gentleman of bearn and it would not have lain within the strength or inclinations of antonio perez as he once had been to have resisted the temptation that she offered ever avid of pleasure he had denied himself no single cup of it that favouring fortune had proffered him it was indeed because of this that he was fallen from his high estate it

was a woman who had pulled him down in ruin tumbling with him to her doom she poor soul was dead at last which was the best that any lover could have wished her but he lived on embittered vengeful with gall in his veins instead of blood he was the pale faded shadow of that arrogant reckless joyous antonio perez beloved of fortune he was fifty gaunt holloweyed and grey half crippled by torture sickly from long years of incarceration what he asked himself sitting there his eyes upon the eternal snows of the barrier that shut out his past was there left in him to awaken love in such a woman as madame de chantenac was it that his tribulations stirred her pity or that the fame of him which rang through europe shed upon his withering frame some of the transfiguring radiance of romance it marked indeed the change in him that he should pause to question whose erstwhile habit had been blindly to accept the good things tossed by fortune into his lap but question he did pondering that parting taunt of hers to which for emphasis she had given an odd redundancyyou a spaniard of spain could her meaning have been plainer was not a spaniard proverbially as quick to love as to jealousy was not spain that scented land of warmth and colour of cruelty and blood of throbbing lutes under lattices ajar of mitred sinners doing public penance that land where lust and piety went hand in hand where passion and penitence lay down togetherwas not spain the land of loves most fruitful growth and was not a spaniard the very hierophant of love his thoughts swung with sudden yearning to his wife juana and their children held in brutal captivity by philip who sought to slake upon them some of the vindictiveness from which their husband and father had at last escaped not that antonio perez observed marital fidelity more closely than any other spaniard of his time or of any time but antonio perez was growing old older than he thought older than his years he knew it madame de chantenac had proved it to him she had reproached him with never coming to see her at chantenac neglecting to return the too assiduous visits that she paid him here at pau you are very beautiful madame and the world is very foul he had excused himself believe one who knows the world to his bitter cost tongues will wag and your spanish pride will not suffer that clods may talk of you i am thinking of you madame of me she had answered why of me they talk alreadytalk their fill i must pretend blindness to the leering eyes that watch me each time i come to pau feign unconsciousness of the impertinent glances of the captain of the castle there as i ride in then why do you come he had asked pointblank but before her sudden change of countenance he had been quick to add oh madame i am full conscious of the charity that brings you and i am deeply deeply grateful but charity she had interrupted sharply on a laugh that was selfmocking charity what else madame ask yourself she had answered reddening and averting her face from his questioning eyes madame he had faltered i dare not dare not madame how should i i am an old man broken by sickness disheartened by misfortune daunted by tribulationa mere husk cast aside by fortune whilst you are lovely as one of the angels about the throne of heaven she had looked into the haggard face into the scars of suffering that seared it and she had answered gently tomorrow you shall come to me at chantenac my friend i am a spaniard for whom tomorrow never comes but it will this time tomorrow i shall expect you he looked up at her sitting her great black horse beside which he had been pacing better not madame better not he had said and then he saw the eyes that had been tender grow charged with scorn then came her angry taunt you a spaniard of spain i do not believe it oh there was no doubt that he had angered her women of her temperament are quick to anger as to every emotion but he had not wished to anger her god knows it was never the way of antonio perez to anger lovely womenat least not in this fashion and it was an ill return for her gentleness and attention to himself considering this as he sat there now he resolved that he must make amendsthe only amends it was possible to make an hour later in one of the regal rooms of the castle where he enjoyed the hospitality of king henri iv of france and navarre he announced to that most faithful equerry gil de mesa his intention of riding to chantenac tomorrow is it prudent quoth mesa frowning most imprudent answered don antonio that is why i go and on the morrow he went escorted by a single groom gil de mesa had begged at first to be allowed to accompany him but for gil he had other work of which the instructions he left were very full the distance was shortthree miles along the gave de pauand don antonio covered it on a gently ambling mule such as might have been bred to bear some aged dignitary of holy church the lords of chantenac were as noble as proud and as poor as most great lords of bearn their lineage was long their rentrolls short and the last marquis had suffered more from this dual complaint than any of his forbears and he had not at all improved matters by a certain habit of gaming contracted in youth the chateau bore abundant signs of it it was a burnt red pile standing foursquare on a little eminence about the base of which

the river went winding turbulently it was turreted at each of its four angles imposing in its way but in a sad state of dilapidation and disrepair the interior when don antonio reached it was rather better the furnishings though sparse were massive and imposing the tapestries on the walls if old were rich and choice but everywhere the illassorted marriage of pretentiousness and neediness was apparent the floors of hall and livingroom were strewn with freshcut rushes an obsolescent custom which served here alike to save the heavy cost of carpets and to lend the place an ancient baronial dignity whilst pretence was made of keeping state the servitors were all old and insufficient in number to warrant the retention of the infirm seneschal by whom don antonio was ceremoniously received a single groom aged and without livery took charge at once of don antonios mule his servants horse and the servant himself the seneschal hobbling before him conducted our spaniard across the great hall gloomy and half denuded through the main livingroom of the chateau into a smaller more intimate apartment holding some trace of luxury which he announced as madames own room and there he left him to await the coming of the chatelaine she at least showed none of the outward disrepair of her surroundings she came to him sheathed in a gown of shimmering silk that was of the golden brown of autumn tints caught to her waist by a slender girdle of hammered gold eyes of deepest blue pondered him questioningly whilst red lips smiled their welcome so you have come in spite of all she greeted him be very welcome to my poor house don antonio and regally she proffered her hand to his homage he took it observing the shapely pointed fingers the delicately curving nails reluctantly almost he admitted to himself how complete was her beauty how absolute her charm he sigheda sigh for that lost youth of his perhapsas he bowed from his fine lean height to press cold lips of formal duty on that hand your will madame was stronger than my prudence said he prudence quoth she and almost sneered since when has antonio perez stooped to prudence since paying the bitter price of imprudence you know my story a little i know for instance that you murdered escovedoall the world knows that is that the imprudence of which you speak i have heard it said that it was for love of a woman that you did it you have heard that too he said he had paled a little you have heard a deal marquise i wonder would it amuse you to hear more to hear from my own lips this story of mine which all europe garbles would it there was a faint note of anxiety in his voice a look faintly anxious in his eyes she scanned him a moment gravely almost inscrutably what purpose can it serve she asked and her tone was forbiddingalmost a tone of fear it will explain he insisted explain what how it comes that i am not this moment prostrate at your feet how it happens that i am not on my knees to worship your heavenly beauty how i have contrived to remain insensible before a loveliness that in happier times would have made me mad vive dieu she murmured half ironical perhaps that needs explaining how it became necessary he pursued never heeding the interruption that yesterday you should proclaim your disbelief that i could be as you said a spaniard of spain how it happens that antonio perez has become incapable of any emotion but hate will you hear the storyall of it he was leaning towards her his white face held close to her own a smouldering fire in the dark sunken eyes that now devoured her she shivered and her own cheeks turned very pale her lips were faintly twisted as if in an effort to smile my friendif you insist she consented it is the purpose for which i came he announced for a long moment each looked into the others eyes with a singular intentness that nothing here would seem to warrant at length she spoke come she said you shall tell me and she waved him to a chair set in the embrasure of the mullioned window that looked out over a tract of meadowland sweeping gently down to the river don antonio sank into the chair placing his hat and whip upon the floor beside him the marquise faced him occupying the padded windowseat her back to the light her countenance in shadow and here in his own words follows the story that he told her as she herself set it down soon after whilst more elaborate and intimate in parts it yet so closely agrees throughout with his own famous relacion that i do not hesitate to accept the assurance she has left us that every word he uttered was burnt as if by an acid upon her memory the story of antonio perez as a lovestory this is i think the saddest that ever was invented by a romancer intent upon wringing tears from sympathetic hearts how sad it is you will realize when i tell you that daily i thank god on my kneesfor i still believe in god despite what was alleged against me by the inquisitors of aragonthat she who inspired this love of which i am to tell you is now in the peace of death she died in exile at pastrana a year ago anne de mendoza was what you call in france a great parti she came of one of the most illustrious families in spain and she was a great heiress so much all the world knew what the world forgot was that she was a woman with a womans heart and mind a womans natural instincts to select her mate there are fools who envy the noble and the wealthy

they are little to be envied those poor pawns in the game of statecraft moved hither and thither at the will of players who are themselves no better the human nature of them is a negligible appendage to the names and rentrolls that predetermine their place upon the board of worldly ambition a board befouled by blood by slobberings from the evil mouth of greed and by infamy of every kind so because anne was a daughter of the house of mendoza because her endowments were great they plucked her from her convent at the age of thirteen years knowing little more of life than the merest babe and they flung her into the arms of ruy gomez prince of eboli who was old enough to have been her father but eboli was a great man in spain perhaps the greatest he was first minister to philip ii and between his house and that of mendoza an alliance was desired to establish it that tender child was sacrificed without ruth she discovered that life held nothing of all that her maiden dreamings had foreseen that it was a thing of horror and greed and lovelessness and worse for there was much worse to come eboli brought his childprincess to court he wore her lightly as a ribbon or a glove the insignificant appendage to the wealth and powerful alliance he had acquired with her and at court she came under the eye of that pious satyr philip the catholic king is very devoutperfervidly devout he prays he fasts he approaches the sacraments he does penance all in proper season as prescribed by mother church he abominates sin and lack of faithparticularly in others he has drenched flanders in blood that he might wash it clean of the heresy of thinking differently from himself in spiritual matters and he would have done the same by england but that godwho cannot after all be quite of philips way of thinkingwilled otherwise all this he has done for the greater honour and glory of his maker but he will not tolerate his makers interference with his own minor pleasures of the flesh he is as you would say a spaniard of spain this satyrs protruding eyes fell upon the lovely princess of ebolifor lovely she was a very pearl among women i spare you details eboli was most loyal and submissive where his king was concerned most complacent and accommodating that was but logical and need not shock you at all to advance his worldly ambitions had he taken anne to wife why should he scruple then to yield her again that thus he might advance those ambitions further if poor anne argued at all she must have argued thus for the rest she was told that to be loved by the king was an overwhelming honour a matter for nightly prayers of thankfulness philip was something very exalted hardly human in fact almost if not quite divine who and what was anne that she should dispute with those who knew the world and who placed these facts before her never in all her little life had she belonged to herself always had she been the property of somebody else to be dealt with as her owner might consider best if about the court she saw some men more nearly of her own agethough there were not many for philips court was ever a gloomy sparsely peopled placeshe took it for granted that such men were not for her this until i taught her otherwise which however was not yet a while had i been at court in those days i think i should have found the means at whatever cost of preventing that infamy for i know that i loved her from the day i saw her but i was of no more than her own age and i had not yet been drawn into that whirlpool so she went to the arms of that rachitic prince and she bore him a sonfor as all the world knows the duke of prastana owns philip for his father and eboli increased in power and prosperity and the favour of his master and also no doubt in the contempt of posterity there are times when the thought of posterity and its vengeances is of great solace it would be some six years later when first i came to court brought thither by my father to enter the service of the prince of eboli as one of his secretaries as i have told you i loved the princess from the moment i beheld her from the gossip of the court i pieced together her story and pitied her and pitying her i loved her the more her beauty dazzled me her charm enmeshed me and she had grown by now in worldly wisdom and mental attainments yet i set a mask upon my passion and walked very circumspectly for all that by nature i was as reckless and profligate as all the world could ever call me she was the wife of the puissant secretary of state the mistress of the king who was i to dispute their property to those exalted ones and another consideration stayed me she seemed to love the king young and lacking in wisdom this amazed me in age he compared favourably with her husband he was but thirteen years older than herselfbut in nothing else he was a weedy unhealthylooking man weakly of frame rachitic undersized with spindleshanks and a countenance that was almost grotesque with its protruding jaw gaping mouth great doglike eyes and yellow tuft of beard a great king perhaps this philip having so been born but a ridiculous man and an unspeakable lover and yet this incomparable woman seemed to love him let me pass on for ten years i nursed that love of mine in secret i was helped perhaps by the fact that in the mean time i had marriedoh just as eboli
Document 77
himself had married an arrangement dictated by worldly considerationsand no better truer mate did ever a man find than i in juana coello we had children and we were happy and for a seasonfor years indeedi began to think that my unspoken passion for the princess of eboli was dead and done with i saw her rarely now and my activities increased with increasing duties at twentysix i was one of the ministers of the crown and one of the chief supporters of that party of which eboli was the leader in spanish politics i sat in philips council and i came under the spell of that taciturn suspicious man who utterly unlovable as he was had yet an uncanny power of inspiring devotion from the spell of it i never quite escaped until after long years of persecution yet the discovery that one by nature so entirely antipathetic to me should have obtained such sway over my mind helped me to understand annes attachment to him when eboli died in i had so advanced in ability and royal favour that i took his place as secretary of state thus becoming all but the supreme ruler of spain i do not believe that there was ever in spain a minister so highly favoured by the reigning prince so powerful as i became not eboli himself in his halcyon days had been so deeply esteemed of philip or had wielded such power as i now made my own all europe knows itfor it was to me all europe addressed itself for affairs that concerned the catholic king and with my power came wealthabundant prodigious wealth i was housed like a prince of the blood and no prince of the blood ever kept greater state than i was ever more courted fawned upon or t flattered and remember i was young little more than thirty with all the strength and zest to enjoy my intoxicating eminence i was to my party what eboli had been though the nominal leader of it remained quiroga archbishop of toledo on the other side was the duke of alva with his following you must know that it was king philips way to encourage two rival parties in the state between which he shared his confidence and sway thus he stimulated emulation and enlightened his own views in the opposing opinions that were placed before him but the power of my party was absolute in those days and alva himself was as the dust beneath our feet such eminences they say are perilous heads that are very highly placed may at any moment be placed still higherupon a pike i am all but a living witness to the truth of that and yet i wonder would it so have fallen out with me had i mistrusted that slumbering passion of mine for anne i should have known that where such fires have once been kindled in a man they never quite die out as long as life endures time and preoccupations may overlay them as with a film of ashes but more or less deeply down they smoulder on and the first breath will fan them into flame again it was at the kings request i went to see her in her fine madrid house opposite santa maria mayor some months after her husbands death there were certain matters of heritage to be cleared up and having regard to her high rank it was philips wish that iwho was by now ebolis official successorshould wait on her in person there were documents to be conned and signed and the matter took some days for ebolis possessions were not only considerable but scattered and his widow displayed an acquired knowledge of affairs and a natural wisdom that inspired her to probe deeply to my undoing she probed too deeply in one matter it concerned some landa little propertyat velez she had been attached to the place it seemed and she missed all mention of it from the papers that i brought her she asked the reason it is disposed of i told her disposed of quoth she but by whom by the prince your husband a little while before he died she looked up at meshe was seated at the wide carved writingtable i standing by her sideas if expecting me to say more as i left my utterance there she frowned perplexedly but what mystery is this she asked me to whom has it gone to one sancho gordo to sancho gordo the frown deepened the washerwomans son you will not tell me that he bought it i do not tell you so madame it was a gift from the prince your husband a gift she laughed to sancho gordo so the washerwomans child is ebolis son and again she laughed on a note of deep contempt madame i cried appalled and full of pity i assure you that you assume too much the prince let be she interrupted me do you dream i care what rivals i may have had however lowly they may have been the prince my husband is dead and that is very well he is much better dead don antonio the pity of it is that he ever lived or else that i was born a woman she was staring straight before her her hands fallen to her lap her face set as if carved and lifeless and her voice came hard as the sound of one stone beating upon another do you dream what it can mean to have been so nurtured on indignities that there is no anger left no pride to wound by the discovery of yet another nothing but cold cold hate that don antonio is my case you do not know what my life has been that man he is dead madame i reminded her out of pity and damned i hope she answered me in that same cold emotionless voice he deserves no less for all
Document 78
the wrongs he did to me the least of which was the great wrong of marrying me for advancement he acquired me for his advancement he bartered and used me and made of me a thing of shame i was so overwhelmed with grief and love and pity that a groan escaped me almost before i was aware of it she broke off short and stared at me in haughtiness you presume to pity me i think she reproved me it is my own fault i was wrong to talk women should suffer silently that they may preserve at least a mask of dignity otherwise they incur pityand pity is very near contempt and then i lost my head not mine not mine i cried throwing out my arms and though that was all i said there was such a ring in my choking voice that she rose stiffly from her seat and stood tense and tall confronting me almost eye to eye reproof in every line of her princess forgive me i cried it breaks my heart in pieces to hear you utter things that have been in my mind these many years poisoning the devotion that i owed to the late prince poisoning the very loyalty i owe my king you say i pity you if that were so none has the better right who gave it you she asked me breathless heaven itself i think i answered recklessly what you have suffered i have suffered for you when i came to court the infamy was a thing accomplishedall of it but i gathered it and gathering it thanked heaven i had been spared the pain and misery of witnessing it which must have been more than ever i could have endured yet when i saw you when i watched youyour wistful beauty your incomparable gracethere was a time when the thought to murder stirred darkly in my mind that i might at least avenge you she fell away before me white to the very lips her eyes dilating as they regarded me in gods name why she asked me in a strangled voice because i loved you i replied always always since the day i saw you unfortunately that day was years too late even had i dared to hope antonio something in her voice drew my averted eyes her lips had parted her eyes kindled into life a flush was stirring in her cheeks and i never knew i never knew she faltered piteously i stared dear heaven why did you withhold a knowledge that would have upheld me and enheartened me through all that i have suffered once long long agog i hoped you hoped i hoped antoniolong long ago we were in each others arms she weeping on my shoulder as if her heart would burst i almost mad with mingling joy and painand as god lives there was more matter here for pain than joy we sat long together after that and talked it out there was no help for it it was too late on every count on her side there was the king most jealous of all men whose chattel she was become on mine there was my wife and children and so deep and true was my love for anne that it awakened in me thoughts of the loyalty i owed juana thoughts that had never troubled me hitherto in my pleasureloving lifeand this not only as concerned anne herself but as concerned all women there was something so ennobling and sanctifying about our love that it changed at once the whole of my life the whole tenor of my ways i abandoned profligacy and became so staid and orderly in my conduct that i was scarcely recognizable for the antonio perez whom the world had known hitherto we parted there that day with a resolve to put all this behind us to efface from our minds all memory of what had passed between us poor fools were we to imagine we could resist the vortex of circumstance which had caught us for three months we kept our engagement scrupulously and then at last resistance mutually exhausted we yielded each to the other both to fate but because we cherished our love we moved with caution i was circumspect in my comings and goings and such were the precautions we observed that for four years the world had little suspicion and certainly no knowledge that i had inherited from the prince of eboli more than his office as secretary of state this secrecy was necessary as long as philip lived for we were both fully aware of what manner of vengeance we should have to reckon with did knowledge of our relations reach the jealous king and i think that but for don john of austrias affairs and the intervention in them of the escovedo whom you saywhom the world says i murdered all might have been well to this day escovedo had been like myself one of ebolis secretaries in his day and it was this that won him after ebolis death a place at the royal council board it was but an inferior place yet the king remarked him for a man shrewd and able who might one day have his uses that day was not very long in coming though the opportunity it afforded escovedo was scarcely such as in his greedy insatiable ambition he had hoped for yet the opportunity such as it was was afforded him by me and had he used it properly it should have carried him far certainly much farther than his talent and condition warranted it came about through don john of austrias dreams of sovereignty you will have heardas who has notso much of don john the natural son of charles v that i need tell you little concerning him in body and soul he was a very different man indeed from his halfbrother philip of spain as joyous as

philip was gloomy as open and frank as philip was cloudy and suspicious and as beautiful as philip was grotesque don john was the bayard of our day the very mirror of all knightly graces to the victory of lepanto which had made him illustrious as a soldier he had added in the year of ebolis death the conquest of tunis thereby completing the triumph of christianity over the muslim in the mediterranean success may have turned his head a little he was young you know and an emperors son he dreamt of an empire for himself of sovereignty and of making tunis the capital of the kingdom he would found we learnt of this indeed don john made little secret of his intentions but they went not at all with philips views it was far from his notions that don john should go founding kingdoms of his own his valour and talents were required to be employed for the greater honour and glory of the crown of spain and nothing further philip consulted me who was by then the depositary of all his secrets the familiar of his inmost desires there was evidence that don johns ambitions were being fomented by his secretary who dreamt no doubt of his own aggrandizement in the aggrandizement of his master philip proposed the mans removal that would be something i agreed but not enough he must be replaced by a man of our own a man loyal to your majesty who will not only seek to guide don john in the course that he should follow but will keep close watch upon his projects and warn you should they threaten to neglect your interests the interests of spain for his own and such a man where shall we find him i considered a moment and bethought me of escovedo he was able he had charm and an ingratiating manner i believed him loyal and imagined that i could quicken that loyalty by showing him that advancement would wait upon its observation he could well be spared from the council where as i have said he occupied a quite inferior post lastly we were friends and i was glad of the opportunity to serve him and place him on the road to better things all this i said to philip and so the matter was concluded but escovedo failed me his abilities and ingratiating manner endeared him quickly to don john whilst himself he succumbed entirely not only to don john of austrias great personal charm but also to don johns ambitious projects the road to advancement upon which i had set him seemed to him long and toilsome by contrast with the shorter cut that was offered by his new masters dreams he fell as the earlier secretary had fallen and more grievously for he was the more ambitious of the two and from merely seconding don johns projects it was not long before he spurred them on not long before he was dreaming dreams of his own for don john to realize from tunis which had by now been recovered by the turks and any hopes concerned with which king philip had discouraged the eyes of don john were set at escovedos bidding i believe upon the crown of england he had just been invited by philip to make ready to take in hand the affairs of flanders sadly disorganized under the incompetent rule of alva it occurred to him that if he were to issue victoriously from that enterpriseand so far victory had waited upon his every ventureif he were to succeed in restoring peace and spanish order in rebellious flanders he would then be able to move against england with the spanish troops under his command overthrow elizabeth deliver mary stuart from the captivity in which she languished and by marriage with her set the crown of england on his brow to this great project he sought the support of rome and rome accorded it very readily being naturally hostile to the heretic daughter of anne boleyn it was escovedo himself who went as don johns secret ambassador to the vatican in this affair escovedo who had been placed with don john to act as a curb on that young mans ambitions nor did he move with the prudence he should have observed knowledge of what was brewing reached us from the papal nuncio in madrid who came to see me one day in the matter i have a dispatch from rome he announced in which his holiness instructs me to enjoin upon the king that the expedition against england be now executed and that he consider bestowing its crown upon don john of austria for the greater honour and glory of holy church i was thunderstruck the expedition against england i knew was no new project three years before a secret envoy from the queen of scots an italian named ridolfi had come to propose to philip that in concert with the pope he should reestablish the catholic faith in england and place mary stuart upon the throne it was a scheme attractive to philip since it agreed at once with his policy and his religion but it had been abandoned under the dissuasions of alva who accounted that it would be too costly even if successful here it was again emanating now directly from the holy see but in a slightly altered form why don john of austria i asked him a great soldier of the faith and the queen of scots must have a husband i should have thought that she had had husbands enough by now said i his holiness does not appear to share that view he answered tartly i wonder will the king said i the catholic king is ever an obedient child of mother church the oily nuncio reminded me to reprove my doubt but i knew betterthat the kings own policy was the measure of his obedience this the nuncio should

learn for himself for if i knew anything of philips mind i knew precisely how he would welcome this proposal will you see the king now i suggested maliciously anxious to witness the humbling of his priestly arrogance not yet it is upon that i came to see you i am instructed first to consult with one escoda as to the manner in which this matter shall be presented to his majesty who is escoda i never heard of him said i perhaps he comes from rome no no strange he muttered frowning and plucked a parchment from his sleeve it is here he peered slowly at the writing and slowly spelled out the name juan de escoda in a flash it came to me escovedo you mean i cried yes yesescovedo to be sure he agreed having consulted the writing once more where is he on his way to madrid with don john i informed him he is don johns secretary i will do nothing then until he arrives he said and took his leave oh monstrous indiscretion that dispatch from rome so cunningly and secretly contrived in cipher had yet contained no warning that escovedos share in this should be concealed there are none so imprudent as the sly i sought the king at once and told him all that i had learnt he was aghast indeed i never saw him more near to anger for philip of spain was not the man to show wrath or any other emotion he had a fishlike cold impenetrable inscrutability true his yellow skin grew yellower his gaping mouth gaped wider his goggle eyes goggled more than usual left to himself i think he would have disgraced don john and banished escovedo there and then as he did indeed suggest and i have since had cause enough to wish to god that i had left him to himself who will replace don john in flanders i asked him quietly he stared at me he is useful to you there use him sire to your own ends but they will press this english business acquiesce acquiesce are you mad seem to acquiesce temporize answer them one thing at a time say when the flanders business is happily concluded we will think of england give them hope that success in flanders will dispose you to support the other project thus you offer don john an incentive to succeed yet commit yourself to nothing and this dog escovedo is a dog who betrays himself by his bark we will listen for it and thus it was determined thus was don john suckled on the windy pap of hope when presently he came to court with escovedo at his heels distended by that empty fare he went off to the low countries leaving escovedo in madrid to represent him with secret instructions to advance his plans now escovedos talents were far inferior to my conception of them he was just a greedy schemer without the wit to dissemble his appetite or the patience necessary to secure attainment affairs in flanders went none too well yet that did not set a curb upon him he pressed his masters business upon the king with an ardour amounting to disrespect and disrespect was a thing the awful majesty of philip could never brook escovedo complained of delays of indecision and finallyin the summer of he wrote the king a letter of fierce upbraidings criticizing his policy in terms that were contemptuous and which entirely exasperated philip it was in vain i strove to warn the fellow of whither he was drifting in vain i admonished and sought to curb his headlong recklessness i have said that i had a friendship for him and because of that i took more pains perhaps than i should have taken in anothers case unless you put some judgment into that head of yours my friend you will leave it in this business i told him one day he flung into a passion at the admonition heaped abuse upon me swore that it was i who thwarted him i who opposed the fulfilment of don johns desires and fostered the dilatory policy of the king i left him after that to pursue his course having no wish to quarrel with this headstrong upstart yet liking him as i did i spared no endeavour to shield him from the consequences he provoked but that letter of his to philip made the task a difficult one philip showed it to me if that man he said had uttered to my face what he has dared to write i do not think i should have been able to contain myself without visible change of countenance it is a sanguinary letter i set myself to calm him as best i could the man is indiscreet which has its advantage for we always know whither an indiscreet man is heading his zeal for his master blinds him and makes him rash it is better perhaps than if he were secretive and crafty with such arguments i appeased his wrath against the secretary but i knew that his hatred of escovedo his thirst for escovedos blood dated from that moment in which escovedo had forgotten the reverence due to majesty i was glad when at last he took himself off to flanders to rejoin don john but that was very far from setting a term to his pestering the flanders affair was going so badly that the hopes of an english throne to follow were dwindling fast something else must be devised against the worst and now don john and escovedo began to consider the acquisition of power in spain itself their ambition aimed at giving don john the standing of an infante both of them wrote to me to advance this fresh project of theirs to work for their recall so that they could ally themselves with my partythe archbishops partyand ensure its continuing supreme escovedo wrote me

a letter that was little better than an attempt to bribe me the king was ageing and the prince was too young to relieve him of the heavy duties of state don john should shoulder these and in so doing escovedo and myself should be hoisted into greater power i carried all those letters to the king and at his suggestion i even pretended to lend an ear to these proposals that we might draw from escovedo a fuller betrayal of his real ultimate aims it was dangerous and i enjoined the king to move carefully be discreet i warned him for if my artifice were discovered i should not be of any further use to you at all in my conscience i am satisfied that in acting as i do i am performing no more than my duty i require no theology other than my own to understand that much my theology he answered me takes much the same view you would have failed in your duty to god and me had you failed to enlighten me on the score of this deception these things he added in a dull voice appal me so i wrote to don john urging him as one who counselled him for his good who had no interest but his own at heart to remain in flanders until the work there should be satisfactorily completed he did so since he was left no choice in the matter but the intrigues continued later we saw how far he was from having forsaken his dreams of england when i discovered that he had engaged the pope to assist him with six thousand men and one hundred and fifty thousand ducats when the time for that adventure should be ripe and then quite suddenly entirely unheralded escovedo reappeared in madrid having come to press philip in person for reinforcements that should enable don john to finish the campaign he brought news that there had been a fresh rupture of the patchedup peace that don john had taken the field once more and had forcibly made himself master of namur this was contrary to all the orders we had sent a direct overriding of philips wishes the king desired peace in the low countries because he was in no case just then to renew the war and escovedos impudently couched demands completed his exasperation my will he said is as naught before the ambitions of these two you sent my clear instructions to escovedo who was placed with don john that he might render him pliant to my wishes instead he stiffens him in rebellion there must be an end to this man sire i cried it may be they think to advance your interests heaven help me he cried did ever villain wear so transparent a mask as this dog escovedo to advance my intereststhat will be his tale no doubt he will advance them where i do not wish them advanced he will advance them to my ruin he will stake all on a success in flanders that shall be the preliminary to a descent upon england in the interests of don john i say there must be an end to this man before he works more mischief again i set myself to calm him as i had so often done before and again i was the shield between escovedo and the royal lightnings of whose menace to blot him out the fool had no suspicion for months things hung there until in january of when war had been forced in earnest upon spain by elizabeths support of the low countries don john won the great victory of gemblours this somewhat raised the kings depression somewhat dissipated his overgrowing mistrust of his halfbrother and gave him patience to read the letters in which don john urged him to send moneyto throw wood on the fire whilst it was alight or else resign himself to the loss of flanders for all time as it meant also resigning himself to the loss of all hope of england for all time escovedos activities were just then increased a hundredfold send me money and escovedo was the burden of the almost daily letters from don john to me and at my elbow was escovedo perpetually pressing me to bend the king to his masters will another matter on which he pressed me then was that i should obtain for himself the governorship of the castle of mogro which commands the port of santander an ambition this which intrigued me deeply for i confess i could not fathom what it had to do with all the rest and then something else happened from the spanish ambassador at the louvre we learnt one day of a secret federation entered into between don john and the guises known as the defence of the two crowns its object was as obscure as its title but it afforded the last drop to the cup of philips mistrust this time it was directly against don john that he inveighed to me and to defend don john in the interests of common justice i was forced to place the blame where it belonged nay sire i assured him these ambitions are not don johns with all his fevered dreams of greatness don john has ever been will ever be loyal to his king if you know anything of temptation he answered me you should know that there is a breakingpoint to every mans resistance of it how long will don john remain loyal while escovedo feeds his disloyalty adds daily to the weight of temptation the burden of a fresh ambition i tell you man i feel safe no longer he rose up before me a blotch on his sallow face his fingers tugging nervously at the tuft of strawcoloured beard i tell you some blow is about to fall unless we avert it this man this fellow escovedomust be dispatched before he can kill us i

shrugged and affected carelessness to soothe him a contemptible dreamer i said pity him sire he has his uses to remove him would be to remove a channel through which we can always obtain knowledge precisely of what is doing again i prevailed and there the matter hung a while but the king was right his fears were well inspired escovedo always impatient was becoming desperate under persistent frustration i reasoned with himwas he not still my friendi held him off urged prudence and patience upon him and generally sought to temporize i was as intent upon saving him from leaving his skin in this business as i was on the other hand intent upon doing my duty without pause or scruple to my king but the fool forced my hand a court is a foul place always even so attenuated a court as that which philip of spain encouraged rumour thrives in it scandal blossoms luxuriantly in its fetid atmosphere and rumour and scandal had been busy with the princess of eboli and me though i did not dream it we had been indiscreet no doubt we had been seen together in public too often we had gone to the play together more than once she had been present with me at a bullfight on one occasion and it was matter of common gossip as i was to learn that i was a too frequent visitor at her house another visitor there was escovedo when in madrid have i not said that in his early days he had been one of ebolis secretaries on that account the house of eboli remained open to him at all times the princess liked him was kindly disposed towards him and encouraged his visits we met there more than once one day we left together and that day the fool set spark to a train that led straight to the mine on which all unconsciously he stood a word of advice in season don antonio he said as we stepped forth together do not go so often to visit the princess i sought to pull my arm from his but he dung to it and pinned it to his side nay nownay now he soothed me not so hot my friend what the devil have i said to provoke resentment i advise you as your friend in future advise that other friend of yours the devil i answered angrily and pulled my arm away at last don juan you have presumed i think i did not seek your advice it is yourself that stands in need of advice this moment more than any man in spain lord of the world he exclaimed in amiable protest listen to him i speak because i owe friendship to the princess men whisper of your comings and goings i tell you and the king you know well should he hear of this i am in danger of losing my only friend at court and so another word of this i broke in fiercely now or at any other time and ill skewer you like a rabbit i had stopped my face was thrust within a handsbreadth of his own i had tossed back my cloak and my fingers clutched the hilt of my sword he became grave his fine eyeshe had great sombre liquid eyes such as youll scarcely ever see outside of spainconsidered me thoughtfully a moment then he laughed lightly and fell back a pace pish said he saint james i am no rabbit for your skewering if it comes to skewers i am a useful man of my hands antonio come manand again he took my armif i presume forgive it out of the assurance that i am moved solely by interest and concern for you we have been friends too long that i should be denied i had grown cool again and i realized that perhaps my show of anger had been imprudent so i relented now and we went our ways together without further show of illhumour on my part or further advice on his but the matter did not end there indeed it but began going early in the afternoon of the morrow to visit anne i found her in tearstears as i was to discover of anger escovedo had been to visit her before me and he had dared to reproach her on the same subject you are talked about you and perez he had informed her and the thing may have evil consequences it is because i have eaten our bread that i tell you this for your own good she had risen up in a great passion you will leave my house and never set foot in it again she had told him you should learn that grooms and lackeys have no concern in the conduct of great ladies it is because you have eaten my bread that i tell you this for your own good it drove him out incontinently but it left her in the condition in which i was later to discover her i set myself to soothe her i swore that escovedo should be punished but she would not be soothed she blamed herself for an unpardonable rashness she should not have taken that tone with escovedo he could avenge himself by telling philip and if he told philip and philip believed himas philip would being jealous and mistrustful beyond all menmy ruin must follow she had thought only of herself in dismissing him in that highhanded manner coming since to think of me it was that she had fallen into this despair she clung to me in tears forgive me antonio the fault is all minethe fault of all always have i known that this danger must overhang you as a penalty for loving me always i knew it and knowing it i should have been stronger i should have sent you from me at the first but i was so starved of

himself perhaps upon the throne of one or the other of the two kingdoms as don johns viceregentfor himself and for me if i stood by him there was such power in store as no man ever dreamed of if i refused he would destroy me and if i go straight to the escurial and lay this project before the king i asked him he smiled you will force me to tell him that it is a lie invented to deliver you from a man who can destroy you by the knowledge he possesses knowledge which i shall at once impart to philip think what that will mean to you think he added very wickedly what it will mean to her as i am a christian i believe that had it been but the consideration of myself i would have flung him from my house upon the instant and bade him do his worst but he was well advised to remind me of her whatever philips punishment of me it would be as nothing to his punishment of that longsuffering woman who had betrayed him oh i assure you it is a very evil ill judged thing to have a king for rival particularly a fishsouled tyrant of king philips kind i was all limp with dread i passed a hand across my brow and found it chill and moist i am in your hands escovedo i confessed miserably say rather that we are partners forget all else he was eager joyous believing all accomplished such was his faith in my influence with philip and now mogro for me and england for don john about it with dispatch the king is in retreat we must wait some days till easter then and he held out his hand i took it limply thus clenching the bargain of infamy between us what else was there for me what otherwise was to become of anne oh i may have been selfseeking and made the most of my position as was afterwards urged against me i may have been extortionate and venal and i may have taken regal bribes to expedite affairs but always was i loyal and devoted to the king never once had i been bribed to aught that ran counter to his interests never until now when at a stroke i had sold my honour and pledged myself to this betrayal of my trust not in all spain was there a more miserable man than i all night i sat in the room where i was wont to work and to my wifes entreaties that i should take some rest i answered that the affairs of spain compelled attention and when morning found me haggard and distraught came a courier from philip with a letter i have letters from don john he wrote more insistent than ever in their tone he demands the instant dispatch of money and escovedo i have been thinking and this letter confirms my every fear i have cause to apprehend some stroke that may disturb the public peace and ruin don john himself if he is allowed to retain escovedo any longer in his service i am writing to don john that i will see to it that escovedo is promptly dispatched as he requests do you see him dispatched then in precise accordance with his deserts and this at once before the villain kills us my skin bristled as i read here was fatality itself at work philip was at his old fearsand heaven knows he was not without justification of his intuitions as i had learnt by nowthat escovedo meditated the most desperate measures he was urging me again as he had urged me before and more than once to dispatch this traitor whose restless existence so perpetually perturbed him i was not deceived as to the meaning he set upon that word dispatch i knew quite well the nature of the dispatch he bade me contrive conceive now my temptation escovedo dead i should be safe and anne would be safe and this without any such betrayal as was being forced upon me and that death the king himself commanded a secret royal execution such as his confessor frey diego de chaves has since defended as an expedient measure within the royal prerogative he had commanded it before quite unequivocally but always i had stood between escovedo and the sword was i to continue in that attitude could it humanly be expected of me in all the circumstances again to seek to deflect the royal wrath from that too daring head i was after all only a man subject to the temptations of the flesh and there was a woman whom i loved better than my own salvation to whose peace and happiness that fellow escovedo was become a menace if he lived and for as long as he lived she and i were to be as slaves of his will and i was to drag my honour and my loyalty through the foul kennels of his disordered ambitions and the king my master was bidding me clearly see to it that he died immediately i sat down and wrote at once and the burden of my letter was be more explicit sire what manner of dispatch is it your will that escovedo should be given on the morrow which was thursday of holy week that note of mine was returned to me and on the margin of it in philips own hand escovedos deathwarrant i mean that it would be well to hasten the death of this rascal before some act of his should render it too late for he never rests nor will anything turn him from his usual ways do it then and do it quickly before he kills us there was no more to be said my instructions were clear and definite obedience alone remained i went about it just as all my life i have been blessed with

the staunchest friends so have i too been blessed with the most faithful servants and of these none was more faithful than my steward diego martinez unless indeed it be my equerry gil de mesa who to this day follows my evil fortunes but mesa at that time was as yet untried whilst in diego i knew that i had a man devoted to me heart and soul a man who would allow himself to be torn limb from limb on the rack on my behalf i placed the affair in diegos hands i told him that i was acting under orders from the king and that the thing at issue was the private execution of a dangerous traitor who could not be brought to trial lest there he should impeach of complicity one whose birth and blood must be shielded from all scandal i bade him get what men he required and see the thing done with the least possible delay and thereupon i instantly withdrew from madrid and went to alcala diego engaged five men to assist him in the task these were a young officer named enriquez a lackey named rubio the two aragonesemesa and insaustiand another whose name was bosque he clearly meant to take no chances but i incline to think that he overdid precaution and employed more hands than were necessary for the job however the six of them lurked in waiting on three successive nights for escovedo near his house in the little square of santiago at last on the night of easter monday march st they caught him and dispatched him he died almost before he realized himself beset from a swordthrust with which insausti transfixed him but there were at least half a dozen wounds in the body when it was found diego i have said was a man who made quite certain no sooner was it done than they dispersed whilst the lackey rubio instantly quitting madrid brought me news of the deed to alcala and the assurance that no arrests had been made but there was a great ado in madrid upon the morrow as you may imagine for it is no everyday occurrence to find a royal secretary murdered in the streets the alcaldes set out upon a rigorous search and they began by arresting and questioning all who attempted to leave the city on the next day they harassed with their perquisitions all those who let lodgings they were still at this work in the evening when i returned to madrid brought backas it would seemfrom my country rest by the news of this murder of my friend and colleague i bore myself as i should have done had i no knowledge of how the thing had been contrived that was a necessity as imperative as it was odious and no part of it more odious than the visit of condolence i was forced to pay to the escovedo family which i found plunged in grief from the very outset suspicion pointed its finger at me although there were no visible traces to connect me with the deed rumour however was astir and as i had powerful friends so too i had the powerful enemies which envy must always be breeding for men in high places such as mine escovedos wife mistrusted me though at first she seems equally to have suspected in this deed the hand of the duke of alva who was hostile to don john and all his creatures very soon as a result of this came the court alcalde to visit and question me his stated object was in the hope that i might give him information which would lead to the discovery of the assassin but his real object rendered apparent by the searching insistent nature of his questions was to lead me to incriminate myself i presented a bold front i pretended to see in this perhaps the work of the flemish states i deploredthat i might remind him of itmy absence from madrid at the time he was followed by another high official who came in simulated friendship to warn me that certain rumours linking me with the deed were in circulation in reality to trap me into some admission to watch my countenance for some betraying sign i endured it stoutly but inwardly i was shaken as i wrote to philip giving him full details of what had been said and what answers i had returned what bitter draughts i had been forced to swallow he wrote in reply i find that you answered very well continue to be prudent they will tell you a thousand things not for the sake of telling them but in the hope of drawing something out of you the bitter draughts you mention are inevitable but use all the dissimulation and address of which you are capable we corresponded daily after that and i told him of every step i took how i kept my men about me for fear that if they attempted to leave madrid they would be arrested and how finally i contrived their departure one by one under conditions that placed them beyond all suspicion juan de mesa set out for aragon on a mission concerned with the administration of some property of the princess of ebolis rubio insausti and enriquez were each given an ensigns commission bearing the kings own signature and ordered to join the armies in various parts of italy the first was sent to milan the second to sicily and the last to naples bosque went back to aragon thus all were placed beyond the reach of the active justice of castile all save myselfand the king who wrote to me expressing his satisfaction that there had been no arrests but rumour continued to give tongue and the burden of its tale was that the murder had been my work in complicity with the princess of eboli how they came to drag her name into

indignantly that she was being accused almost before this had come to pass and as indignantly protested against the accusation and threatened those who dared to voice it the end of it all was that a month later the escovedo family drew up a memorial for the consideration of the king in which they laid the murder to my charge and philip consented to receive don pedro de escovedothe dead mans sonand promised him that he would consider the memorial and that he would deliver up to justice whomsoever he thought right he was embarrassed by these demands of the escovedos my own danger his duty as king and his interests as an accomplice or rather as the originator of the deed the escovedos were powerfully seconded by vasquez the secretary of the council a member of alvas party a secret enemy of my own consumed by jealousy of my power and no longer fearing to disclose himself and assail me since he believed himself possessed of the means of ruining me he spoke darkly to the king of a woman concerned in this business without yet daring to mention anne by name and urged him for the satisfaction of the state where evil rumours were abroad to order an inquiry that should reveal the truth of the affair it was philip himself who informed me of what had passed sneering at the wildness of rumours that missed the truth so wildly and when i evinced distress at my position he sought to reassure me he even wrote to me after i had left him as long as i live you have nothing to fear others may change but i never change as you should know who know me that was a letter that epitomized many others written me in those days to madrid from the escurial whither he had returned and those letters comforted me not only by their expressed assurances but by the greater assurance implicit in them of the kings good faith i had by now a great mass of his notes dealing with the escovedo business in almost every one of which he betrayed his own share as the chief murderer showing that i was no more than his dutiful instrument in that execution with those letters in my power what need i ever fear not philip himself would dare to betray me but i went now in a new dreadthe dread of being myself murdered there were threats of it in the air the escovedo family and their partisans who included all my enemies and even some members of the eboli family who considered that i had sullied the honour of their name by my relations with anne talked openly of vengeance so that i was driven to surround myself by armed attendants whenever now i went abroad i appealed again to philip to protect me i even begged him to permit me to retire from my ministerial office that thus the clamant envy that inspired my persecution might be deprived of its incentive finally i begged him to order me to stand my trial that thus since i was confident that no evidence could be produced against me i should force an acquittal from the courts and lay the matter to rest for all time go and see the president of castile he bade me tell him the causes that led to the death of escovedo and then let him talk to don pedro de escovedo and to vasquez so as to induce them to desist i did as i was bidden and when the president who was the bishop of pati had heard me he sent for my two chief enemies i have don pedro he said your memorial to the king in which you accuse don antonio perez of the murder of your father and i am to assure you in the kings name that justice will be done upon the murderer whoever he may be without regard to rank but i am first to engage you to consider well what evidence you have to justify your charge against a person of such consideration for should your proofs be insufficient i warn you that matters are likely to take a bad turn for yourself finally before you answer me let me add upon my word as a priest that antonio perez is as innocent as i am it was the truththe absolute truth so far as it was known to philip and to the bishopfor indeed i was no more than the instrument of my masters will don pedro looked foolish almost awed he was as a man who suddenly becomes aware that he has missed stepping over the edge of a chasm in which destruction awaited him he may have bethought him at last that all his rantings had no better authority than suspicions which no evidence could support sir he faltered since you tell me this i pledge you my word on behalf of myself and my family to make no more mention of this death against don antonio the bishop swung then upon vasquez and his brow became furrowed with contemptuous anger as for you sir you have heardwhich was more than your due for it is not your business by virtue of your office nor have you any obligations towards the deceased such as excuse don pedros rashness to pursue the murderers of escovedo your solicitude in this matter brings you under a suspicion the more odious since you are a priest i warn you sir to abstain for this affair is different far from anything that you imagine but envy is a fierce goad a consuming irresistible passion corroding wisdom and deaf to all prudent counsels vasquez could not
Document 87
abstain ridden by his devil of spite and jealousy he would not pause until he had destroyed either himself or me since escovedos immediate family now washed their hands of the affair vasquez sought out more distant relatives of the murdered man and stirred them up until they went in their turn to pester the courts not only with accusations against myself but with accusations that now openly linked with mine the name of the princess of eboli we were driven to the brink of despair and in this anne wrote to philip it was a madness she made too great haste to excuse herself she demanded protection from vasquez and the evil rumours he was putting abroad implored the king to make an example of men who could push so far their daring and irreverence and to punish that moorish dog vasquezi dare say there was moorish blood in the fellows veinsas he deserved i think our ruin dated from that letter philip sent for me to the escurial he wished to know more precisely what the accusations were i told him denying them then he desired of the princess proof of what she alleged against vasquez and she had no difficulty in satisfying him he seemed to believe our assurance that all was lies yet he did not move to punish vasquez but then i knew that sluggishness was his great characteristic time and i are one he would say when i pressed on matters after that it was open war in the council between me and vasquez the climax came when i was at the escurial i had sent a servant to vasquez for certain state papers to be submitted to the king he brought them and folded in them a fiercely denunciatory letter full of insults and injuries not the least of which was the imputation that my blood was not clean my caste not good in a passion i sought philip beside myself almost trembling under the insult see sire what this moorish thief has dared to write me it transcends all bearing either you take satisfaction for me of these insults or you permit me to take it for myself he appeared to share my indignation promised to give me leave to proceed against the man but bade me first wait a while until certain business in the competent hands of vasquez should be transacted but weeks grew into months and nothing was done we were in april of a year after the murder and i was grown so uneasy so sensitive to dangers about me that i dared no longer visit anne and then philips confessor frey diego de chaves came to me one day with a request on the kings part that i should make my peace with vasquez if he will retract was my condition and chaves went to see my enemy what passed between them what vasquez may have told him what he may have added to those rumours of my relations with anne i do not know but i know that from that date there was a change in the kings attitude towards me a change in the tone of the letters that he sent me and this continuing i wrote to him at last releasing him from his promise to afford me satisfaction against vasquez assuring him that since himself he could forgive the injuries against us both i could easily forgive those i had received myself and finally begging his permission to resign my office and retire anne had contributed to this she had sent for me and in tears had besought me to make my peace with vasquez since the king desired it and this was no time in which to attempt resistance to his wishes i remained with her some hours comforting her for she was in the very depths of despair persuaded that we were both ruined and inconsolable in the thought that the blame of this was all her own it may be that i was watched perhaps more closely than i imagined it may be that spies were close about us set by the jealous philip who desired confirmation or refutation of the things he had been told the rumours that were gnawing at his vitals i left her little dreaming that i was never to see her again in this life that night i was arrested at my house by the court alcalde upon an order from the king the paltry reason advanced was my refusal to make my peace with vasquez and this when already the king was in possession of my letter acknowledging my readiness to do so for the king was in madrid unknown to me he came it seems that he might be present at another arrest effected that same night from the porch of the church of santa maria mayor he watched his alguazils enter the house of the princess of eboli bring her forth bestow her in a waiting carriage that was to bear her away to the fortress of pinto to an imprisonment which was later exchanged for exile to pastrana lasting as long as life itself to sin against a prince is worse it seems than to sin against god himself for god forgives but princes wounded in their vanity and pride know nothing of forgiveness i was kept for four months a prisoner by the alcalde no charge being preferred against me then because my health was suffering grievously from confinement and the anxiety of suspense i was moved to my own house and detained there for another eight months under close guard my friends besought the king in vain either to restore me to liberty or to bring me to trial he told them the affair was of a nature very different from anything they deemed and so evaded all demands in the summer of philip went to lisbon to take formal possession of the crown of portugal which he had
Document 88
inherited i sent my wife to him to intercede for me but he refused to see her and so i was left to continue the victim of his vindictive lethargy after a year of this upon my giving a formal promise to renounce all hostility towards vasquez and never seek to do him harm in any way i was accorded some degree of liberty i was allowed to go out and to receive visitors but not to visit any one myself followed a further pause vasquez was now a man of power for my party had fallen with me and his own had supplanted it in the royal councils it was by his work that at last in i was brought to trial upon a charge of corruption and misappropriation i knew that my enemies had meanwhile become possessed of enriquez and that he was ready to give evidence that he was making no secret of his share in the death of escovedo and that the king was being pressed by the escovedos to bring me to trial upon the charge of murder instead the other charge alone was preferred it was urged against me that i had kept a greater state than any grandee of spain that when i went abroad i did so with a retinue befitting a prince that i had sold my favour and accepted bribes from foreign princes to guard their interests with the king of spain they sentenced me to two years imprisonment in a fortress to be followed by ten years of exile and i was to make within nine days restitution of some twenty million maravedisthe alleged extent of my misappropriationsbesides some jewels and furniture which i had received from the princess of eboli and which i was now ordered to deliver up to the heirs of the late prince ten thousand pounds but with at least five times the present purchasing power of that sum perquisitions had been made in my house and my papers ransacked well i knew what they had sought for the thought of the letters that had passed between philip and myself at the time of escovedos death must now be troubling his peace of mind i had taken due precautions when first i had seen the gathering clouds foreshadowing this change of weather i had bestowed those papers safely in two ironbound chests which had been concealed away against the time when i might need them to save my neck and because now he failed to find what he soughtthe evidence of his own share in the deed and his present base duplicityphilip dared not slip the leash from those dogs who would be at my throat for the murder of escovedo that was why he bade them proceed against me only on the lesser charge of corruption i was taken to the fortress of turruegano and there they came to demand of me the surrender of my papers which the alcalde had failed to discover at my house i imagined the uneasiness of philip in dispatching those emissaries i almost laughed as i refused those papers were my buckler against worse befalling me than had befallen already even now if too hard pressed i might find the opportunity of breaking my bonds by means of them i sometimes wonder why i did not apply myself to that yet there is small cause for wonder really from boyhood almost king philip had been my master loyalty to him was a habit that went to the very roots of my being i had served him without conscience and without scruple and the notion of betraying him save as a very last and very desperate resource was inconceivable i do not think he ever knew the depth and breadth of that loyalty of mine my refusal led those sons of dogs to attempt to frighten my wife with threats of unmentionable horrors unless she delivered up the papers i had secreted she and our children were threatened with perpetual imprisonment on bread and water if she persisted in refusing to surrender them but she held out against all threats and remained firm even under the oily persecution to the same end of philips confessor frey diego finally i was notified that in view of her stubbornness and my own she and our children were cast into prison and that there they would remain until i saw fit to become submissive to the royal will it is a subtle form of mental torture that will bid a man contemplate the suffering for his sake to which those who are dear to him are being subjected i raged and stormed before the officer who brought me this infamous piece of news i gave vent to my impotent anger in blasphemous expressions that were afterwards to be used against me the officer was subtly sympathetic i understand your grief don antonio he said believe me i feel for youso much that i urge you to set an end to the captivity of those dear ones who are innocent who are suffering for your sake and so make an end of myself i asked him fiercely reflection may show that even that is your duty in the circumstances i looked into his smug face and i was within an ace of striking him then i controlled myself and my will was snapped very well i said the papers shall be surrendered let my steward diego martinez come to me here and he shall receive my instructions to deliver the chests containing them to my wife that she in turn may deliver them to the king he withdrew well pleased no doubt he would take great credit to himself for this within three days such haste did they make my faithful steward stood before me in my prison at turruegano you conceive the despair that had overwhelmed me after giving my consent the consciousness that it was my life i was surrendering with
Document 89
those papersthat without them i should be utterly defenceless but in the three days that were sped i had been thinking and not quite in vain martinez left me with precise instructions as a result of which those two ironbound chests locked and sealed were delivered together with the keys to the royal confessor martinez was asked what they contained i do not know he answered my orders are merely to deliver them i can conceive the kings relief and joy in his conviction that thus had he drawn my teeth that betide now what might i could never defend or justify myself the immediate sequel took me by surprise we were at the end of and my health was suffering from my confinement and its privations and now my captivity was mitigated my wife juana even succeeded in obtaining permission that i should be taken home to madrid and there for fourteen months i enjoyed a half liberty and received the visits of my old friends among whom were numbered most of the members of the court i imagined at first that since my teeth were drawn the king despised me and intended nothing further but i was soon to be disillusioned on that score it began with the arrest of martinez on a charge of complicity in the murder of escovedo and then one day i was again arrested without warning and carried off for a while to the fortress of pinto thence i was brought back in close captivity to madrid and there i learnt at last what had been stirring in the previous summer king philip had gone into aragon to preside over the cortes and vasquez who had gone with him had seized the opportunity to examine the ensign enriquez who had meanwhile denounced himself of complicity in the murder of escovedo enriquez made a full confessionturned accuser under a promise of full pardon for himself and charged mesa rubio and my steward martinez with complicity denouncing martinez as the ringleader of the business the other two insausti and bosque were already dead immediately vasquez attempted to seize the survivors but mesa had gone to earth in aragon and rubio was with him martinez alone remained and him they seized and questioned he remained as cool and master of himself as he was true and loyal to me their threats made no impression on him he maintained that the tale was all a lie begotten of spite that i had been escovedos best friend that i had been greatly afflicted by his death and that no man could have done more than i to discover his real murderers they confronted him with enriquez and the confrontation no whit disturbed him he handled the traitor contemptuously as a perjured suborned witness a false servant a man who as he proceeded to show was a scoundrel steeped in crime whose word was utterly worthless and who no doubt had been bought to bring these charges against his sometime master the situation thanks to martinezs stoutness had reached a deadlock between the assertions of one man who was revealed to the judges for a worthless scoundrel and the denials of the other against whom nothing was known it was impossible for the court of inquiry to reach any conclusion at least another witness must be obtained and vasquez laboured with all his might and arts and wiles to draw rubio out of aragon into the clutches of the justice of castile but he laboured in vain for i had secretly found the means to instruct my trusty mesa to retain the fellow where he was in this inconclusive state of things the months dragged on and my captivity continued i wrote to philip imploring his mercy complaining of these unjust delays on the part of vasquez which threatened to go on forever and begging his majesty to command the conclusion of the affair that was in august of you see how time had sped all that came of my appeal was at first an increased rigour of imprisonment and then a visit from vasquez to examine and question me upon the testimony of enriquez as you can imagine the attempt to lure me into selfbetrayal was completely fruitless my enemy withdrew baffled to go question my wife but without any better success nevertheless vasquez proclaimed the charge established against myself and martinez and allowed us ten days in which to prepare our answer immediately upon that don pedro de escovedo lodged a formal indictment against us and i was put into irons to rebut the evidence of one single tainted witness i produced six witnesses of high repute including the secretary of the council of aragon they testified for me that i was at alcala at the time of escovedos death that i had always been escovedos friend that i was a good christian incapable of such a deed and that enriquez as an evil man whose word was worthless a false witness inspired by vengeance thus in spite of the illwill of my judges and the hatred of my enemies it was impossible legally to condemn me upon the evidence there were documents enough in existence to have proved my part in the affair but not one of them dared the king produce since they would also show me to have been no more than his instrument and so desiring my death as it was now clear he did he must sit impotently brooding there with what patience he could command like a gigantic evil spider into whose web i obstinately refused to fling myself my hopes began to revive when at last the court announced that it postponed judgment whilst fresh evidence was sought there was an outcry of indignation on all sides this was a tyrannical abuse of power men said and i joined my voice to theirs to demand that judgment be pronounced and my liberty restored to me pointing out that i had

already languished years in captivity without any charge against mebeyond that of corruption which had been purged by nowhaving been established then at last the king stirred in his diabolical underground manner he sent his confessor to me in prison the friar was mild and benign my poor friend he said why do you allow yourself to suffer in this fashion when a word from you can set a term to it confess the deed without fear since at the same time you can advance a peremptory reason of state to justify it it was too obvious a trap did i make confession indeed upon such grounds they would demand of me proof of what i asserted and meanwhile the documents to prove it had been extorted from me and had passed into the kings possession in the result i should be ruined completely as one who to the crime of murder added a wicked insidious falsehood touching the honour of his king but i said naught of this i met guile with guile alas i have been tempted i answered him but i thank heaven i have known even in my extremity how to resist the temptation of such disloyalty i cannot forget brother diego that amongst the letters from the king was one that said be not troubled by anything your enemies may do against you i shall not abandon you and be sure their animosity cannot prevail but you must understand that it must not be discovered that this death took place by my order but if the king were to release you from that command he asked when his majesty in his goodness and generosity sends me a note in his own hand to say you may confess that it was by my express order that you contrived the death of escovedo then i shall thankfully account myself absolved from the silence his service imposes on me he looked at me narrowly he may have suspected that i saw through the transparent device to ruin me and that in a sense i mocked him with my answer he withdrew and for some days nothing further happened then the rigours of my captivity were still further increased i was allowed to communicate with no one and even the alguazil who guarded me was forbidden under pain of death to speak to me and in january i was visited by vasquez who brought me a letter from the king not indeed addressed to me and in the terms i had suggested but to vasquez himself and it ran you may tell antonio perez from me and if necessary show him this letter that he is aware of my knowledge of having ordered him to put escovedo to death and of the motives which he told me existed for this measure and that as it imports for the satisfaction of my conscience that it be ascertained whether or not those motives were sufficient i order him to state them in the fullest detail and to advance proof of what he then alleged to me which is not unknown to yourself since i have clearly imparted it to you when i shall have seen his answers and the reasons he advances i shall give order that such measures be taken as may befit i the king you see what a twist he had given to the facts it was i who had urged the death of escovedo it was i who had advanced reasons which he had considered sufficient trusting to my word and it was because of this he had consented to give the order let me confess so much let me prove it and prove too that the motives i had advanced were sound ones or i must be destroyed that was all clear and that false king held fast the two trunks of papers that would have given the lie to this atrocious note of his that would have proved that again and again i had shielded escovedo from the death his king designed for him i looked into the face of my enemy and there was a twisted smile on my lips what fresh trap is this i asked him king philip never wrote that note you should know his hand look closer he bade me harshly i know his handnone better but i claim too to know something of his heart and i know that it is not the heart of a perjured liar such as penned those lines that was as near as a man dared to go in expressing his true opinion of a prince for the rest i said i do not understand it i know nothing of the death of escovedo i have nothing to add to what already i have said in open court unless it be to protest against you who are a passionate hostile judge six times in the month that followed did vasquez come to me accompanied now by a notary to press me to confess at last seeing that no persuasions could bend my obstinacy they resorted to other measures you will drive us to use the torture upon you so that we may loosen your tongue snarled vasquez fiercely enraged by my obduracy i laughed at the threat i was a noble of spain by birth immune from torture they dared not violate the law but they did dare there was no law human or divine the king was not prepared to violate so that he might slake his vengeance upon the man who had dared to love where he had loved they delivered me naked into the hands of the executioner and i underwent the question at the rope they warned me that if i lost my life or the use of any of my limbs it would be solely by my own fault i advanced my nobility and the state of my health as allsufficient reasons why the torture should not be applied
Document 91
to me reminding them that for eleven years already i had suffered persecution and detention so that my vigour was all gone for the last time they summoned me to answer as the king desired and then since i still refused the executioner was recalled he crossed my arms upon my breast bound them securely thrust a long rod beneath the cord and seizing one end of this in either hand gave the first turn i screamed i could not help it enfeebled as i was but my spirit being stouter than my flesh i still refused to answer not indeed until they had given the rope eight turns not until it had sliced through my muscles and crushed the bone of one of my arms so that to this day it remains of little use to me did they conquer me i had reached the limit of endurance in christs name release me i gasped i will say anything you wish released at last half swooning smothered in blood agonized by pain i confessed that it was myself had procured the death of escovedo for reasons of state and acting upon the orders of the king the notary made haste to write down my words and when i had done it was demanded of me that i should advance proof of the state reasons which i had alleged oh i had never been under any delusion on that score as i have shown you the demand did not take me by surprise at all i was waiting for it knowing that my answer to it would pronounce my doom but i delivered it none the less my papers have been taken from me and without them i can prove nothing with them i could prove my words abundantly they left me then on the morrow as i afterwards learnt they read my confession to my devoted martinez and the poor fellow who hitherto had remained staunch and silent under every test seeing that there was no further purpose to be served by silence gave them the confirmation they desired of enriquezs accusation meanwhile i was very ill in a raging fever as you may well conceive and in answer to my prayer my own doctor was permitted to visit me in prison he announced that he found my case extremely grave and that i must perish unless i were relieved as a consequence and considering my weakness and the uselessness just then of both my arms one of which was broken first a page of my own then other servants and lastly my wife were allowed to come and tend me that was at the end of february by the middle of april my wounds had healed i had recovered the use of my limbs though one remains half maimed for life and my condition had undergone a very considerable improvement but of this i allowed no sign to show no suspicion even i continued to lie there day after day in a state of complete collapse so that whilst i was quickly gathering strength it was believed by my gaolers that i was steadily sinking and that i should soon be dead my only hope you see lay now in evasion and it was for this that i was thus craftily preparing once out of castile i could deal with philip and he should not find me as impotent as toothless as he believed but i go too fast one night at last on april th by when all measures had been concerted and gil de mesa awaited me outside with horsesthe whole having been contrived by my dear wifei made the attempt my apparent condition had naturally led to carelessness in guarding me who would guard a helpless dying man soon after dark i rose donned over my own clothes a petticoat and a hooded cloak belonging to my wife and thus muffed walked out of my cell past the guards and so out of the prison unchallenged i joined gil de mesa discarded my feminine disguise mounted and set out with him upon that ninetymile journey into aragon we reached saragossa in safety and there my first act was to surrender myself to the grand justiciary of aragon to stand my trial for the murder of escovedo with which i was charged it must have sent a shudder through the wicked philip when he received news of that a very stricken man he must have been for he must have suspected something of the truth that if i dared after all the evidence amassed now against me including my own confession under torture openly to seek a judgment it was because i must possess some unsuspected means of establishing all the truththe truth that must make his own name stink in the nostrils of the world and so it was have you supposed that antonio perez who had spent his life in studying the underground methods of burrowing statecraft had allowed himself to be taken quite so easily in their snare have you imagined that when i sent for diego martinez to come to me at turruegano and instructed him touching the surrender of those two chests of documents that i did not also instruct him carefully touching the abstraction in the first instance of a few serviceable papers and the renewal of the seals that should conceal the fact that he had tampered with the chests if you have thought that you have done me less than justice there had been so much correspondence between philip and myself so many notes had passed touching the death of escovedo and there was that habit of philips of writing his replies in marginal notes to my own letters and so returning them that it was unthinkable he should have kept them all in his memory and the abstraction of three or four could not conceivably be detected by him ever since then those few letters of a
