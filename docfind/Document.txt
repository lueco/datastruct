jeanne madrid and the staff at casa de vidamay you keep the spirit contents diving under flipped buddy beware the sycamore tree brawkbrawkbrawk the eggs get a grip man the yard looming large and smelly the visit the serious willies the dinner flipped the basket boys diving under all ive ever wanted is for juli baker to leave me alone for her to back off you know just give me some space it all started the summer before second grade when our moving van pulled into her neighborhood and since were now about done with the eighth grade that my friend makes more than half a decade of strategic avoidance and social discomfort she didnt just barge into my life she barged and shoved and wedged her way into my life did we invite her to get into our moving van and start climbing all over boxes no but thats exactly what she did taking over and showing off like only juli baker can my dad tried to stop her hey he says as shes catapulting herself on board what are you doing youre getting mud everywhere so true too her shoes were like caked with the stuff she didnt hop out though instead she planted her rear end on the floor and started pushing a big box with her feet dont you want some help she glanced my way it sure looks like you need it i didnt like the implication and even though my dad had been tossing me the same sort of look all week i could tell he didnt like this girl either hey dont do that he warned her there are some really valuable things in that box oh well how about this one she scoots over to a box labeled lenox and looks my way again we should push it together no no no my dad says then pulls her up by the arm why dont you run along home your mothers probably wondering where you are this was the beginning of my soontobecomeacute awareness that the girl cannot take a hint of any kind does she zip on home like a kid should when theyve been invited to leave no she says oh my mom knows where i am she said it was fine then she points across the street and says we just live right over there my father looks to where shes pointing and mutters oh boy then he looks at me and winks as he says bryce isnt it time for you to go inside and help your mother i knew right off that this was a ditch play and i didnt think about it until later but ditch wasnt a play id run with my dad before face it pulling a ditch is not something discussed with dads its like against parental law to tell your kid its okay to ditch someone no matter how annoying or muddy they might be but there he was putting the play in motion and man he didnt have to wink twice i smiled and said sure thing then jumped off the liftgate and headed for my new front door i heard her coming after me but i couldnt believe it maybe it just sounded like she was chasing me maybe she was really going the other way but before i got up the nerve to look she blasted right past me grabbing my arm and yanking me along this was too much i planted myself and was about to tell her to get lost when the weirdest thing happened i was making this big windmill motion to break away from her but somehow on the downswing my hand wound up tangling into hers i couldnt believe it there i was holding the mud monkeys hand i tried to shake her off but she just clamped on tight and yanked me along saying cmon my mom came out of the house and immediately got the worlds sappiest look on her face well hello she says to juli hi im still trying to pull free but the girls got me in a death grip my moms grinning looking at our hands and my fiery red face and whats your name honey julianna baker i live right over there she says pointing with her unoccupied hand well i see youve met my son she says still grinning away uhhuh finally i break free and do the only manly thing available when youre seven years old i dive behind my mother mom puts her arm around me and says bryce honey why dont you show julianna around the house i flash her help and warning signals with every part of my body but shes not receiving then she shakes me off and says go on juli wouldve tramped right in if my mother hadnt noticed her shoes and told her to take them off and after those were off my mom told her that

her dirty socks had to go too juli wasnt embarrassed not a bit she just peeled them off and left them in a crusty heap on our porch i didnt exactly give her a tour i locked myself in the bathroom instead and after about ten minutes of yelling back at her that no i wasnt coming out anytime soon things got quiet out in the hall another ten minutes went by before i got the nerve to peek out the door no juli i snuck out and looked around and yes she was gone not a very sophisticated ditch but hey i was only seven my troubles were far from over though every day she came back over and over again can bryce play i could hear her asking from my hiding place behind the couch is he ready yet one time she even cut across the yard and looked through my window i spotted her in the nick of time and dove under my bed but man that right there tells you something about juli baker shes got no concept of personal space no respect for privacy the world is her playground and watch out below julis on the slide lucky for me my dad was willing to run block and he did it over and over again he told her i was busy or sleeping or just plain gone he was a lifesaver my sister on the other hand tried to sabotage me any chance she got lynettas like that shes four years older than me and buddy ive learned from watching her how not to run your life shes got antagonize written all over her just look at her not crosseyed or with your tongue sticking out or anything just look at her and youve started an argument i used to knockdowndragout with her but its just not worth it girls dont fight fair they pull your hair and gouge you and pinch you then they run off gasping to mommy when you try and defend yourself with a fist then you get locked into timeout and for what no my friend the secret is dont snap at the bait let it dangle swim around it laugh it off after a while theyll give up and try to lure someone else at least thats the way it is with lynetta and the bonus of having her as a painintherear sister was figuring out that this method works on everyone teachers jerks at school even mom and dad seriously theres no winning arguments with your parents so why get all pumped up over them it is way better to dive down and get out of the way than it is to get clobbered by some parental tidal wave the funny thing is lynettas still clueless when it comes to dealing with mom and dad she goes straight into thrash mode and is too busy drowning in the argument to take a deep breath and dive for calmer water and she thinks im stupid anyway true to form lynetta tried to bait me with juli those first few days she even snuck her past dad once and marched her all around the house hunting me down i wedged myself up on the top shelf of my closet and lucky for me neither of them looked up a few minutes later i heard dad yell at juli to get off the antique furniture and once again she got booted i dont think i went outside that whole first week i helped unpack stuff and watched tv and just kind of hung around while my mom and dad arranged and rearranged the furniture debating whether empire settees and french rococo tables should even be put in the same room so believe me i was dying to go outside but every time i checked through the window i could see juli showing off in her yard shed be heading a soccer ball or doing high kicks with it or dribbling it up and down their driveway and when she wasnt busy showing off shed just sit on the curb with the ball between her feet staring at our house my mom didnt understand why it was so awful that that cute little girl had held my hand she thought i should make friends with her i thought you liked soccer honey why dont you go out there and kick the ball around because i didnt want to be kicked around thats why and although i couldnt say it like that at the time i still had enough sense at age seven and a half to know that juli baker was dangerous unavoidably dangerous as it turns out the minute i walked into mrs yelsons secondgrade classroom i was dead meat bryce juli squeals youre here then she charges across the room and tackles me mrs yelson tried to explain this attack away as a welcome hug but man that was no hug that was a frontline takeemdown tackle and even though i shook her off it was too late i was branded for life everyone jeered wheres your girl friend bryce are you married yet bryce and then when she chased me around at recess and tried to lay kisses on me the whole school started singing bryce and juli sitting in a tree kissi ng my first year in town was a disaster third grade wasnt much better she was still hot on my trail every time i turned around same with fourth but then in fifth grade i took action it started out slow one of those nahthatsnotright ideas you get and forget but the more i played with the idea the more i thought what better way to ward juli off what better way to say to her juli you are not my type and so my friend i hatched the plan i asked shelly stalls out to fully appreciate the brilliance of this you have to understand

that juli hates shelly stalls she always has though it beats me why shellys nice and shes friendly and shes got a lot of hair whats not to like but juli hated her and i was going to make this little gem of knowledge the solution to my problem what i was thinking was that shelly would eat lunch at our table and maybe walk around a little with me that way anytime juli was around all id have to do was hang a little closer to shelly and things would just naturally take care of themselves what happened though is that shelly took things way too seriously she went around telling everybody including juli that we were in love in no time juli and shelly got into some kind of catfight and while shelly was recovering from that my supposed friend garrett who had been totally behind this plan told her what i was up to hes always denied it but ive since learned that his code of honor is easily corrupted by weepy females that afternoon the principal tried crossexamining me but i wouldnt cop to anything i just kept telling her that i was sorry and that i really didnt understand what had happened finally she let me go shelly cried for days and followed me around school sniffling and making me feel like a real jerk which was even worse than having juli as a shadow everything blew over at the oneweek mark though when shelly officially dumped me and started going out with kyle larsen then juli started up with the googoo eyes again and i was back to square one now in sixth grade things changed though whether they improved is hard to say i dont remember juli actually chasing me in the sixth grade but i do remember her sniffing me yes my friend i said sniffing and you can blame that on our teacher mr mertins he stuck juli to me like glue mr mertins has got some kind of doctorate in seating arrangements or something because he analyzed and scrutinized and practically baptized the seats we had to sit in and of course he decided to seat juli right next to me juli baker is the kind of annoying person who makes a point of letting you know shes smart her hand is the first one up her answers are usually complete dissertations her projects are always turned in early and used as weapons against the rest of the class teachers always have to hold her project up and say this is what im looking for class this is an example of aplus work add all the extra credit she does to an already perfect score and i swear shes never gotten less than percent in any subject but after mr mertins stuck juli right next to me her annoying knowledge of all subjects far and wide came in handy see suddenly julis perfect answers written in perfect cursive were right across the aisle just an eyeshot away you wouldnt believe the number of answers i snagged from her i started getting as and bs on everything it was great but then mr mertins pulled the shift he had some new idea for optimizing positional latitude and longitude and when the dust finally settled i was sitting right in front of juli baker this is where the sniffing comes in that maniac started leaning forward and sniffing my hair shed edge her nose practically up to my scalp and sniffsniffsniff i tried elbowing and backkicking i tried scooting my chair way forward or putting my backpack between me and the seat nothing helped shed just scoot up too or lean over a little farther and sniffsniffsniff i finally asked mr mertins to move me but he wouldnt do it something about not wanting to disturb the delicate balance of educational energies whatever i was stuck with her sniffing and since i couldnt see her perfectly penned answers anymore my grades took a dive especially in spelling then one time during a test julis in the middle of sniffing my hair when she notices that ive blown a spelling word a lot of words suddenly the sniffing stops and the whispering starts at first i couldnt believe it juli baker cheating but sure enough she was spelling words for me right in my ear julid always been sly about sniffing which really bugged me because no one ever noticed her doing it but she was just as sly about giving me answers which was okay by me the bad thing about it was that i started counting on her spelling in my ear i mean why study when you dont have to right but after a while taking all those answers made me feel sort of indebted to her how can you tell someone to bug off or quit sniffing you when you owe them its you know wrong so i spent the sixth grade somewhere between uncomfortable and unhappy but i kept thinking that next year next year things would be different wed be in junior high a big school in different classes it would be a world with too many people to worry about ever seeing juli baker again it was finally finally going to be over flipped the first day i met bryce loski i flipped honestly one look at him and i became a lunatic its his eyes something in his eyes theyre blue and framed in the blackness of his lashes theyre dazzling absolutely breathtaking its been over six years now and i learned long ago to hide my feelings but oh those first days those first years i thought i would die for wanting to be with him two days before the second grade is when it started although the anticipation began weeks beforeever since my mother had told me that there was a family with a boy my age moving into the new house right
Document 4
across the street soccer camp had ended and id been so bored because there was nobody absolutely nobody in the neighborhood to play with oh there were kids but every one of them was older that was dandy for my brothers but what it left me was home alone my mother was there but she had better things to do than kick a soccer ball around so she said anyway at the time i didnt think there was anything better than kicking a soccer ball around especially not the likes of laundry or dishes or vacuuming but my mother didnt agree and the danger of being home alone with her was that shed recruit me to help her wash or dust or vacuum and she wouldnt tolerate the dribbling of a soccer ball around the house as i moved from chore to chore to play it safe i waited outside for weeks just in case the new neighbors moved in early literally it was weeks i entertained myself by playing soccer with our dog champ mostly hed just block because a dog cant exactly kick and score but once in a while hed dribble with his nose the scent of a ball must overwhelm a dog though because champ would eventually try to chomp it then lose the ball to me when the loskis moving van finally arrived everyone in my family was happy little julianna was finally going to have a playmate my mother being the truly sensible adult that she is made me wait more than an hour before going over to meet him give them a chance to stretch their legs julianna she said theyll want some time to adjust she wouldnt even let me watch from the yard i know you sweetheart somehow that ball will wind up in their yard and youll just have to go retrieve it so i watched from the window and every few minutes id ask now and shed say give them a little while longer would you then the phone rang and the minute i was sure she was good and preoccupied i tugged on her sleeve and asked now she nodded and whispered okay but take it easy ill be over there in a minute i was too excited not to charge across the street but i did try very hard to be civilized once i got to the moving van i stood outside looking in for a recordbreaking length of time which was hard because there he was about halfway back my new suretobe best friend bryce loski bryce wasnt really doing much of anything he was more hanging back watching his father move boxes onto the liftgate i remember feeling sorry for mr loski because he looked worn out moving boxes all by himself i also remember that he and bryce were wearing matching turquoise polo shirts which i thought was really cute really nice when i couldnt stand it any longer i called hi into the van which made bryce jump and then quick as a cricket he started pushing a box like hed been working all along i could tell from the way bryce was acting so guilty that he was supposed to be moving boxes but he was sick of it hed probably been moving things for days it was easy to see that he needed a rest he needed some juice something it was also easy to see that mr loski wasnt about to let him quit he was going to keep on moving boxes around until he collapsed and by then bryce might be dead dead before hed had the chance to move in the tragedy of it catapulted me into the moving van i had to help i had to save him when i got to his side to help him shove a box forward the poor boy was so exhausted that he just moved aside and let me take over mr loski didnt want me to help but at least i saved bryce id been in the moving van all of three minutes when his dad sent him off to help his mother unpack things inside the house i chased bryce up the walkway and thats when everything changed you see i caught up to him and grabbed his arm trying to stop him so maybe we could play a little before he got trapped inside and the next thing i know hes holding my hand looking right into my eyes my heart stopped it just stopped beating and for the first time in my life i had that feeling you know like the world is moving all around you all beneath you all inside you and youre floating floating in midair and the only thing keeping you from drifting away is the other persons eyes theyre connected to yours by some invisible physical force and they hold you fast while the rest of the world swirls and twirls and falls completely away i almost got my first kiss that day im sure of it but then his mother came out the front door and he was so embarrassed that his cheeks turned completely red and the next thing you know hes hiding in the bathroom i was waiting for him to come out when his sister lynetta saw me in the hallway she seemed big and mature to me and since she wanted to know what was going on i told her a little bit about it i shouldnt have though because she wiggled the bathroom doorknob and started teasing bryce something fierce hey baby brother she called through the door theres a hot chick out here waiting for you whatsa matter afraid shes got cooties it was so embarrassing i yanked on her arm and told her to stop it but she wouldnt so finally i just left i found my mother outside talking to mrs loski mom had given her the beautiful lemon bundt cake that was
Document 5
supposed to be our dessert that night the powdered sugar looked soft and white and the cake was still warm sending sweet lemon smells into the air my mouth was watering just looking at it but it was in mrs loskis hands and i knew there was no getting it back all i could do was try to eat up the smells while i listened to the two of them discuss grocery stores and the weather forecast after that mom and i went home it was very strange i hadnt gotten to play with bryce at all all i knew was that his eyes were a dizzying blue that he had a sister who was not to be trusted and that hed almost kissed me i fell asleep that night thinking about the kiss that might have been what did a kiss feel like anyway somehow i knew it wouldnt be like the one i got from mom or dad at bedtime the same species maybe but a radically different beast to be sure like a wolf and a whippetonly science would put them on the same tree looking back on the second grade i like to think it was at least partly scientific curiosity that made me chase after that kiss but to be honest it was probably more those blue eyes all through the second and third grades i couldnt seem to stop myself from following him from sitting by him from just wanting to be near him by the fourth grade id learned to control myself the sight of himthe thought of himstill sent my heart humming but my legs didnt actually chase after him anymore i just watched and thought and dreamed then in the fifth grade shelly stalls came into the picture shelly stalls is a ninny a whiny gossipy backstabbing ninny who says one thing to one person and the opposite to another now that were in junior high shes the undisputed diva of drama but even back in elementary school she knew how to put on a performance especially when it came to pe i never once saw her run laps or do calisthenics instead she would go into her delicate act claiming her body would absolutely collapse from the strain if she ran or jumped or stretched it worked every year shed bring in some note and be sure to swoon a little for the teacher the first few days of the year after which shed be excused from anything that required muscles she never even put up her own chair at the end of the day the only muscles she exercised regularly were the ones around her mouth and those she worked out nonstop if there was an olympic contest for talking shelly stalls would sweep the event well shed at least win the gold and silver one medal for each side of her mouth what bugged me about it was not the fact that she got out of pewhod want her on their team anyway what bugged me about it was that anyone who bothered to look would know that it wasnt asthma or weak ankles or her being delicate that was stopping her it was her hair she had mountains of it twisted this way or that clipped or beaded braided or swirled her ponytails rivaled the ones on carousel horses and on the days she let it all hang down shed sort of shimmy and cuddle inside it like it was a blanket so that practically all you saw of her face was her nose good luck playing foursquare with a blanket over your head my solution to shelly stalls was to ignore her which worked just dandy until about halfway through the fifth grade when i saw her holding hands with bryce my bryce the one who was still embarrassed over holding my hand two days before the second grade the one who was still too shy to say much more than hello to me the one who was still walking around with my first kiss how could shelly have wormed her hand into his that pushy little princess had no business hanging on to him like that bryce looked over his shoulder from time to time as they walked along and he was looking at me my first thought was that he was telling me he was sorry then it dawned on me he needed my help absolutely thats what it had to be shelly stalls was too delicate to shake off too swirly to be pushed away shed unravel and start sniffling and oh how embarrassing that would be for him no this wasnt a job a boy could do gracefully this was a job for a girl i didnt even bother checking around for other candidatesi had her off of him in two seconds flat bryce ran away the minute he was free but not shelly oh nonono she came at me scratching and pulling and twisting anything she could get her hands on telling me that bryce was hers and there was no way she was letting him go how delicate i was hoping for herds of teachers to appear so they could see the real shelly stalls in action but it was too late by the time anyone arrived on the scene i had fluffy in a headlock and her arm twisted back in a hammerlock and no amount of her squawking or scratching was going to get me to un lock her until a teacher arrived in the end shelly went home early with a bad case of mussedup hair while i told my side of things to the principal mrs shultz is a sturdy lady who probably secretly appreciates the value of a swift kick well placed and although she told me that it would be better if i let other people work out their own dilemmas she definitely understood about shelly stalls and her hair and told me she

was glad id had the selfcontrol to do nothing more than restrain her shelly was back the next day with a head full of braids and of course she got everybody whispering about me but i just ignored them the facts spoke for themselves bryce didnt go anywhere near her for the rest of the year thats not to say that bryce held my hand after that but he did start being a little friendlier to me especially in the sixth grade after mr mertins sat us right next to each other in the third row back sitting next to bryce was nice he was nice hed say hi juli to me every morning and once in a while id catch him looking my way hed always blush and go back to his own work and i couldnt help but smile he was so shy and so cute we talked to each other more too especially after mr mertins moved me behind him mr mertins had a detention policy about spelling where if you missed more than seven out of twentyfive words you had to spend lunch inside with him writing your words over and over and over again the pressure of detention made bryce panic and even though it bothered my conscience id lean in and whisper answers to him hoping that maybe i could spend lunch with him instead his hair smelled like watermelon and his ear lobes had fuzz soft blond fuzz and i wondered about that how does a boy with such black hair wind up with blond ear fuzz whats it doing there anyway i checked my own earlobes in the mirror but couldnt find much of anything on them and i didnt spot any on other peoples either i thought about asking mr mertins about earlobe fuzz when we were discussing evolution in science but i didnt instead i spent the year whispering spelling words sniffing watermelon and wondering if i was ever going to get my kiss buddy beware seventh grade brought changes all right but the biggest one didnt happen at school it happened at home granddad duncan came to live with us at first it was kind of weird because none of us really knew him except for mom of course and even though shes spent the past year and a half trying to convince us hes a great guy from what i can tell the thing he likes to do best is stare out the frontroom window theres not much to see out there except the bakers front yard but you can find him there day or night sitting in the big easy chair they moved in with him staring out the window okay so he also reads tom clancy novels and the newspapers and does crossword puzzles and tracks his stocks but those things are all distractions given no one to justify it to the man would stare out the window until he fell asleep not that theres anything wrong with that it just seems so boring mom says he stares like that because he misses grandma but thats not something granddad had ever discussed with me as a matter of fact he never discussed much of anything with me until a few months ago when he read about juli in the newspaper now juli baker did not wind up on the front page of the mayfield times for being an eighth grade einstein like you might suspect no my friend she got frontpage coverage because she refused to climb out of a sycamore tree not that i could tell a sycamore from a maple or a birch for that matter but juli of course knew what kind of tree it was and passed that knowledge along to every creature in her wake so this tree this sycamore tree was up the hill on a vacant lot on collier street and it was massive massive and ugly it was twisted and gnarled and bent and i kept expecting the thing to blow over in the wind one day last year id finally had enough of her yakking about that stupid tree i came right out and told her that it was not a magnificent sycamore it was in reality the ugliest tree known to man and you know what she said she said i was visually challenged visually challenged this from the girl who lives in a house thats the scourge of the neighborhood theyve got bushes growing over windows weeds sticking out all over the place and a barnyards worth of animals running wild im talking dogs cats chickens even snakes i swear to god her brothers have a boa constrictor in their room they dragged me in there when i was about ten and made me watch it eat a rat a live beadyeyed rat they held that rodent up by its tail and gulp the boa swallowed it whole that snake gave me nightmares for a month anyway normally i wouldnt care about someones yard but the bakers mess bugged my dad bigtime and he channeled his frustration into our yard he said it was our neighborly duty to show them what a yards supposed to look like so while mike and matt are busy plumping up their boa im having to mow and edge our yard then sweep the walkways and gutter which is going a little overboard if you ask me and youd think julis dadwhos a big strong bricklaying dude would fix the place up but no according to my mom he spends all his free time painting his landscapes dont seem like anything special to me but judging by his price tags he thinks quite a lot of them we see them every year at the mayfield county fair and my parents always say the same thing the world would have more beauty in it if hed fix up the yard instead mom and julis mom do talk some i think my

mom feels sorry for mrs baker she says she married a dreamer and because of that one of the two of them will always be unhappy whatever maybe julis aesthetic sensibilities have been permanently screwed up by her father and none of this is her fault but juli has always thought that that sycamore tree was gods gift to our little corner of the universe back in the third and fourth grades she used to clown around with her brothers in the branches or peel big chunks of bark off so they could slide down the crook in its trunk it seemed like they were playing in it whenever my mom took us somewhere in the car julid be swinging from the branches ready to fall and break every bone in her body while we were waiting at the stoplight and my mom would shake her head and say dont you ever climb that tree like that do you hear me bryce i never want to see you doing that you either lynetta that is much too dangerous my sister would roll her eyes and say as if while id slump beneath the window and pray for the light to change before juli squealed my name for the world to hear i did try to climb it once in the fifth grade it was the day after juli had rescued my kite from its mutant toyeating foliage she climbed miles up to get my kite and when she came down she was actually very cool about it she didnt hold my kite hostage and stick her lips out like i was afraid she might she just handed it over and then backed away i was relieved but i also felt like a weenie when id seen where my kite was trapped i was sure it was a goner not juli she scrambled up and got it down in no time man it was embarrassing so i made a mental picture of how high shed climbed and the next day i set off to outdo her by at least two branches i made it past the crook up a few limbs and then just to see how i was doing i looked down mistake it felt like i was on top of the empire state building without a bungee i tried looking up to where my kite had been but it was hopeless i was indeed a treeclimbing weenie then junior high started and my dream of a julifree existence shattered i had to take the bus and youknowwho did too there were about eight kids altogether at our bus stop which created a buffer zone but it was no comfort zone juli always tried to stand beside me or talk to me or in some other way mortify me and then she started climbing the girl is in the seventh grade and shes climbing a tree way way up in a tree and why does she do it so she can yell down at us that the bus is five four three blocks away blowbyblow traffic watch from a tree what every kid in junior high feels like hearing first thing in the morning she tried to get me to come up there with her too bryce come on you wont believe the colors its absolutely magnificent bryce youve got to come up here yeah i could just hear it bryce and juli sitting in a tree was i ever going to leave the second grade behind one morning i was specifically not looking up when out of nowhere she swings down from a branch and practically knocks me over heart attack i dropped my backpack and wrenched my neck and that did it i refused to wait under that tree with that maniac monkey on the loose anymore i started leaving the house at the very last minute i made up my own waiting spot and when id see the bus pull up id truck up the hill and get on board no juli no problem and that my friend took care of the rest of seventh grade and almost all of eighth too until one day a few months ago thats when i heard a commotion up the hill and could see some big trucks parked up on collier street where the bus pulls in there were some men shouting stuff up at juli who was of course five stories up in the tree all the other kids started to gather under the tree too and i could hear them telling her she had to come down she was fine that was obvious to anyone with a pair of ears but i couldnt figure out what they were all arguing about i trucked up the hill and as i got closer and saw what the men were holding i figured out in a hurry what was making juli refuse to come out of the tree chain saws dont get me wrong here okay the tree was an ugly mutant tangle of gnarly branches the girl arguing with those men was juli the worlds peskiest bossiest most knowitall female but all of a sudden my stomach completely bailed on me juli loved that tree stupid as it was she loved that tree and cutting it down would be like cutting out her heart everyone tried to talk her down even me but she said she wasnt coming down not ever and then she tried to talk us up bryce please come up here with me they wont cut it down if were all up here for a second i considered it but then the bus arrived and i talked myself out of it it wasnt my tree and even though she acted like it was it wasnt julis either we boarded the bus and left her behind but school was pretty much a waste i couldnt seem to stop thinking about juli was she still up in the tree

were they going to arrest her when the bus dropped us off that afternoon juli was gone and so was half the tree the top branches the place my kite had been stuck her favorite perch they were all gone we watched them work for a little while the chain saws gunning at full throttle smoking as they chewed through wood the tree looked lopsided and naked and after a few minutes i had to get out of there it was like watching someone dismember a body and for the first time in ages i felt like crying crying over a stupid tree that i hated i went home and tried to shake it off but i kept wondering should i have gone up the tree with her would it have done any good i thought about calling juli to tell her i was sorry theyd cut it down but i didnt it wouldve been too i dont know weird she didnt show at the bus stop the next morning and didnt ride the bus home that afternoon either then that night right before dinner my grandfather summoned me into the front room he didnt call to me as i was walking by that would have bordered on friendliness what he did was talk to my mother who talked to me i dont know what its about honey she said maybe hes just ready to get to know you a little better great the mans had a year and a half to get acquainted and he chooses now to get to know me but i couldnt exactly blow him off my grandfathers a big man with a meaty nose and greasedback saltandpepper hair he lives in house slippers and a sports coat and ive never seen a whisker on him they grow but he shaves them off like three times a day its a real recreational activity for him besides his meaty nose hes also got big meaty hands i suppose youd notice his hands regardless but what makes you realize just how beefy they are is his wedding ring that things never going to come off and even though my mother says thats how it should be i think he ought to get it cut off another few pounds and that rings going to amputate his finger when i went in to see him those big hands of his were woven together resting on the newspaper in his lap i said granddad you wanted to see me have a seat son son half the time he didnt seem to know who i was and now suddenly i was son i sat in the chair opposite him and waited tell me about your friend juli baker juli shes not exactly my friend why is that he asked calmly like he had prior knowledge i started to justify it then stopped myself and asked why do you want to know he opened the paper and pressed down the crease and thats when i realized that juli baker had made the front page of the mayfield times there was a huge picture of her in the tree surrounded by a fire brigade and policemen and then some smaller photos i couldnt make out very well can i see that he folded it up but didnt hand it over why isnt she your friend bryce because shes i shook my head and said youd have to know juli id like to what why because the girls got an iron backbone why dont you invite her over sometime an iron backbone granddad you dont understand that girl is a royal pain shes a show off shes a knowitall and she is pushy beyond belief is that so yes thats absolutely so and shes been stalking me since the second grade he frowned then looked out the window and asked theyve lived there that long i think they were all born there he frowned some more before he looked back at me and said a girl like that doesnt live next door to everyone you know lucky them he studied me long and hard i said what but he didnt flinch he just kept staring at me and i couldnt take it i had to look away keep in mind that this was the first real conversation id had with my grandfather this was the first time hed made the effort to talk to me about something besides passing the salt and does he want to get to know me no he wants to know about juli i couldnt just stand up and leave even though thats what i felt like doing somehow i knew if i left like that hed quit talking to me at all even about salt so i sat there feeling sort of tortured was he mad at me how could he be mad at me i hadnt done anything wrong when i looked up he was sitting there holding out the newspaper to me read this he said without prejudice i took it and when he went back to looking out the window i knew id been dismissed by the time i got down to my room i was mad i slammed my bedroom door and flopped down on the bed and after fuming about my sorry excuse for a grandfather for a while i shoved the newspaper in the bottom drawer of my desk like i needed to know any more about juli baker at dinner my mother asked me why i was so sulky and she kept looking from me to my grandfather granddad didnt seem to need any salt which was a good thing because i might have thrown the shaker at him my sister and dad were all business as usual though lynetta ate about two raisins out of her carrot salad then peeled the skin and meat off her chicken wing and nibbled gristle off the bone while my father filled up airspace talking about

office politics and the need for a shakedown in upper management no one was listening to him no one ever does when he gets on one of his ifiranthe circus jags but for once mom wasnt even pretending and for once she wasnt trying to convince lynetta that dinner was delicious either she just kept eyeing me and granddad trying to pick up on why we were miffed at each other not that he had anything to be miffed at me about what had i done to him anyway nothing nada but he was i could tell and i completely avoided looking at him until about halfway through dinner when i sneaked a peek he was studying me all right and even though it wasnt a mean stare or a hard stare it was you know firm steady and it weirded me out what was his deal i didnt look at him again or at my mother i just went back to eating and pretended to listen to my dad and the first chance i got i excused myself and holed up in my room i was planning to call my friend garrett like i usually do when im bent about something i even punched in his number but i dont know i just hung upand later when my mom came in i faked like i was sleeping i havent done that in years the whole night was weird like that i just wanted to be left alone juli wasnt at the bus stop the next morning or friday morning she was at school but youd never know it if you didnt actually look she didnt whip her hand through the air trying to get the teacher to call on her or charge through the halls getting to class she didnt make unsolicited comments for the teachers edification or challenge the kids who took cuts in the milk line she just sat quiet i told myself i should be glad about it it was like she wasnt even there and isnt that what id always wanted but still i felt bad about her tree about how she hurried off to eat by herself in the library at lunch about how her eyes were red around the edges i wanted to tell her man im sorry about your sycamore tree but the words never seemed to come out by the middle of the next week theyd finished taking down the tree they cleared the lot and even tried to pull up the stump but that sucker would not budge so they wound up grinding it down into the dirt juli still didnt show at the bus stop and by the end of the week i learned from garrett that she was riding a bike he said hed seen her on the side of the road twice that week putting the chain back on the derailleur of a rusty old ten speed i figured shed be back it was a long ride out to mayfield junior high and once she got over the tree shed start riding the bus again i even caught myself looking for her not on the lookout just looking then one day it rained and i thought for sure shed be up at the bus stop but no garrett said he saw her trucking along on her bike in a bright yellow poncho and in math i noticed that her pants were still soaked from the knees down when math let out i started to chase after her to tell her that she ought to try riding the bus again but i stopped myself in the nick of time what was i thinking that juli wouldnt take a little friendly concern and completely misinterpret it whoa now buddy beware better to just leave well enough alone after all the last thing i needed was for juli baker to think i missed her the sycamore tree i love to watch my father paint or really i love to hear him talk while he paints the words always come out soft and somehow heavy when hes brushing on the layers of a landscape not sad weary maybe but peaceful my father doesnt have a studio or anything and since the garage is stuffed with things that everyone thinks they need but no one ever uses he paints outside outside is where the best landscapes are only theyre nowhere near our house so what he does is keep a camera in his truck his job as a mason takes him to lots of different locations and hes always on the lookout for a great sunrise or sunset or even just a nice field with sheep or cows then he picks out one of the snapshots clips it to his easel and paints the paintings come out fine but ive always felt a little sorry for him having to paint beautiful scenes in our backyard which is not exactly picturesque it never was much of a yard but after i started raising chickens things didnt exactly improve dad doesnt seem to see the backyard or the chickens when hes painting though its not just the snapshot or the canvas he sees either its something much bigger he gets this look in his eye like hes transcended the yard the neighborhood the world and as his big callused hands sweep a tiny brush against the canvas its almost like his body has been possessed by some graceful spiritual being when i was little my dad would let me sit beside him on the porch while he painted as long as id be quiet i dont do quiet easily but i discovered that after five or ten minutes without a peep hed start talking ive learned a lot about my dad that way he told me all sorts of stories about what hed done when he was my age and other things toolike how he got his first job delivering hay and how he

wished hed finished college when i got a little older he still talked about himself and his childhood but he also started asking questions about me what were we learning at school what book was i currently reading what did i think about this or that then one time he surprised me and asked me about bryce why was i so crazy about bryce i told him about his eyes and his hair and the way his cheeks blush but i dont think i explained it very well because when i was done dad shook his head and told me in soft heavy words that i needed to start looking at the whole landscape i didnt really know what he meant by that but it made me want to argue with him how could he possibly understand about bryce he didnt know him but this was not an arguing spot those were scattered throughout the house but not out here we were both quiet for a recordbreaking amount of time before he kissed me on the forehead and said proper lighting is everything julianna proper lighting what was that supposed to mean i sat there wondering but i was afraid that by asking id be admitting that i wasnt mature enough to understand and for some reason it felt obvious like i should understand after that he didnt talk so much about events as he did about ideas and the older i got the more philosophical he seemed to get i dont know if he really got more philosophical or if he just thought i could handle it now that i was in the double digits mostly the things he talked about floated around me but once in a while something would happen and i would understand exactly what he had meant a painting is more than the sum of its parts he would tell me and then go on to explain how the cow by itself is just a cow and the meadow by itself is just grass and flowers and the sun peeking through the trees is just a beam of light but put them all together and youve got magic i understood what he was saying but i never felt what he was saying until one day when i was up in the sycamore tree the sycamore tree had been at the top of the hill forever it was on a big vacant lot giving shade in the summer and a place for birds to nest in the spring it had a builtin slide for us too its trunk bent up and around in almost a complete spiral and it was so much fun to ride down my mom told me she thought the tree must have been damaged as a sapling but survived and now maybe a hundred years later it was still there the biggest tree shed ever seen a testimony to endurance is what she called it i had always played in the tree but i didnt become a serious climber until the fifth grade when i went up to rescue a kite that was stuck in its branches id first spotted the kite floating free through the air and then saw it divebomb somewhere up the hill by the sycamore tree ive flown kites before and i knowsometimes theyre gone forever and sometimes theyre just waiting in the middle of the road for you to rescue them kites can be lucky or they can be ornery ive had both kinds and a lucky kite is definitely worth chasing after this kite looked lucky to me it wasnt anything fancy just an oldfashioned diamond with blue and yellow stripes but it stuttered along in a friendly way and when it divebombed it seemed to do so from exhaustion as opposed to spite ornery kites divebomb out of spite they never get exhausted because they wont stay up long enough to poop out thirty feet up they just sort of smirk at you and crash for the fun of it so champ and i ran up to collier street and after scouting out the road champ started barking at the sycamore tree i looked up and spotted it too flashing blue and yellow through the branches it was a long ways up but i thought id give it a shot i shinnied up the trunk took a shortcut across the slide and started climbing champ kept a good eye on me barking me along and soon i was higher than id ever been but still the kite seemed forever away then below me i noticed bryce coming around the corner and through the vacant lot and i could tell from the way he was looking up that this was his kite what a lucky lucky kite this was turning out to be can you climb that high he called up to me sure i called back and up up up i went the branches were strong with just the right amount of intersections to make climbing easy and the higher i got the more amazed i was by the view id never seen a view like that it was like being in an airplane above all the rooftops above the other trees above the world then i looked down down at bryce and suddenly i got dizzy and weak in the knees i was miles off the ground bryce shouted can you reach it i caught my breath and managed to call down no problem then forced myself to concentrate on those blue and yellow stripes to focus on them and only them as i shinnied up up up finally i touched it i grasped it i had the kite in my hand but the string was tangled in the branches above and i couldnt seem to pull it free bryce called break the string and somehow i managed to do just that when i had the kite free i needed a minute to rest

to recover before starting down so instead of looking at the ground below me i held on tight and looked out out across the rooftops thats when the fear of being up so high began to lift and in its place came the most amazing feeling that i was flying just soaring above the earth sailing among the clouds then i began to notice how wonderful the breeze smelled it smelled like sunshine like sunshine and wild grass and pomegranates and rain i couldnt stop breathing it in filling my lungs again and again with the sweetest smell id ever known bryce called up are you stuck which brought me down to earth carefully i backed up prized stripes in hand and as i worked my way down i could see bryce circling the tree watching me to make sure i was okay by the time i hit the slide the heady feeling id had in the tree was changing into the heady realization that bryce and i were alone alone my heart was positively racing as i held the kite out to him but before he could take it champ nudged me from behind and i could feel his cold wet nose against my skin against my skin i grabbed my jeans in back and thats when i realized the seat of my pants was ripped wide open bryce laughed a little nervous laugh so i could tell he knew and for once mine were the cheeks that were beet red he took his kite and ran off leaving me to inspect the damage i did eventually get over the embarrassment of my jeans but i never got over the view i kept thinking of what it felt like to be up so high in that tree i wanted to see it to feel it again and again it wasnt long before i wasnt afraid of being up so high and found the spot that became my spot i could sit there for hours just looking out at the world sunsets were amazing some days theyd be purple and pink some days theyd be a blazing orange setting fire to clouds across the horizon it was on a day like that when my fathers notion of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts moved from my head to my heart the view from my sycamore was more than rooftops and clouds and wind and colors combined it was magic and i started marveling at how i was feeling both humble and majestic how was that possible how could i be so full of peace and full of wonder how could this simple tree make me feel so complex so alive i went up the tree every chance i got and in junior high that became almost every day because the bus to our school picks up on collier street right in front of the sycamore tree at first i just wanted to see how high i could get before the bus pulled up but before long i was leaving the house early so i could get clear up to my spot to see the sun rise or the birds flutter about or just the other kids converge on the curb i tried to convince the kids at the bus stop to climb up with me even a little ways but all of them said they didnt want to get dirty turn down a chance to feel magic for fear of a little dirt i couldnt believe it id never told my mother about climbing the tree being the truly sensible adult that she is she would have told me it was too dangerous my brothers being brothers wouldnt have cared that left my father the one person i knew would understand still i was afraid to tell him hed tell my mother and pretty soon theyd insist that i stop so i kept quiet kept climbing and felt a somewhat lonely joy as i looked out over the world then a few months ago i found myself talking to the tree an entire conversation just me and a tree and on the climb down i felt like crying why didnt i have someone real to talk to why didnt i have a best friend like everyone else seemed to sure there were kids i knew at school but none of them were close friends theyd have no interest in climbing the tree in smelling the sunshine that night after dinner my father went outside to paint in the cold of the night under the glare of the porch light he went out to put the finishing touches on a sunrise hed been working on i got my jacket and went out to sit beside him quiet as a mouse after a few minutes he said whats on your mind sweetheart in all the times id sat out there with him hed never asked me that i looked at him but couldnt seem to speak he mixed two hues of orange together and very softly he said talk to me i sighed so heavily it surprised even me i understand why you come out here dad he tried kidding me would you mind explaining it to your mother really dad i understand now about the whole being greater than the sum of the parts he stopped mixing you do what happened tell me about it so i told him about the sycamore tree about the view and the sounds and the colors and the wind and how being up so high felt like flying felt like magic he didnt interrupt me once and when my confession was through i looked at him and whispered would you climb up there with me he thought about this a long time then smiled and said im not much of a climber anymore julianna but ill give it a shot sure how about this weekend when weve got lots of daylight

to work with great i went to bed so excited that i dont think i slept more than five minutes the whole night saturday was right around the corner i couldnt wait the next morning i raced to the bus stop extra early and climbed the tree i caught the sun rising through the clouds sending streaks of fire from one end of the world to the other and i was in the middle of making a mental list of all the things i was going to show my father when i heard a noise below i looked down and parked right beneath me were two trucks big trucks one of them was towing a long empty trailer and the other had a cherry picker on itthe kind they use to work on overhead power lines and telephone poles there were four men standing around talking drinking from thermoses and i almost called down to them im sorry but you cant park there thats a bus stop but before i could one of the men reached into the back of a truck and started unloading tools gloves ropes a chain earmuffs and then chain saws three chain saws and still i didnt get it i kept looking around for what it was they could possibly be there to cut down then one of the kids who rides the bus showed up and started talking to them and pretty soon he was pointing up at me one of the men called hey you better come down from there we gotta take this thing down i held on to the branch tight because suddenly it felt as though i might fall i managed to choke out the tree yeah now come on down but who told you to cut it down the owner he called back but why even from forty feet up i could see him scowl because hes gonna build himself a house and he cant very well do that with this tree in the way now come on girl weve got work to do by that time most of the kids had gathered for the bus they werent saying anything to me just looking up at me and turning from time to time to talk to each other then bryce appeared so i knew the bus was about to arrive i searched across the rooftops and sure enough there it was less than four blocks away my heart was crazy with panic i didnt know what to do i couldnt leave and let them cut down the tree i cried you cant cut it down you just cant one of the men shook his head and said i am this close to calling the police you are trespassing and obstructing progress on a contracted job now are you going to come down or are we going to cut you down the bus was three blocks away id never missed school for any reason other than legitimate illness but i knew in my heart that i was going to miss my ride youre going to have to cut me down i yelled then i had an idea theyd never cut it down if all of us were in the tree theyd have to listen hey guys i called to my classmates get up here with me they cant cut it down if were all up here marcia tony bryce cmon you guys dont let them do this they just stood there staring up at me i could see the bus one block away come on you guys you dont have to come up this high just a little ways please the bus blasted up and pulled to the curb in front of the trucks and when the doors folded open one by one my classmates climbed on board what happened after that is a bit of a blur i remember the neighbors gathering and the police with megaphones i remember the fire brigade and some guy saying it was his blasted tree and id darn well better get out of it somebody tracked down my mother who cried and pleaded and acted not at all the way a sensible mother should but i was not coming down i was not coming down then my father came racing up he jumped out of his pickup truck and after talking with my mother for a few minutes he got the guy in the cherry picker to give him a lift up to where i was after that it was all over i started crying and tried to get him to look out over the rooftops but he wouldnt he said that no view was worth his little girls safety he got me down and he took me home only i couldnt stay there i couldnt stand the sound of chain saws in the distance so dad took me with him to work and while he put up a block wall i sat in his truck and cried i mustve cried for two weeks straight oh sure i went to school and i functioned the best i could but i didnt go there on the bus i started riding my bike instead taking the long way so i wouldnt have to go up to collier street up to a pile of sawdust that used to be the earths most magnificent sycamore tree then one evening when i was locked up in my room my father came in with something under a towel i could tell it was a painting because thats how he transports the important ones when he shows them in the park he sat down resting the painting on the floor in front of him i always liked that tree of yours he said even before you told me about it oh dad its okay ill get over it no julianna no you wont i started crying it was just a tree i never want you to convince yourself of that
Document 13
you and i both know it isnt true but dad bear with me a minute would you he took a deep breath i want the spirit of that tree to be with you always i want you to remember how you felt when you were up there he hesitated a moment then handed me the painting so i made this for you i pulled off the towel and there was my tree my beautiful majestic sycamore tree through the branches hed painted the fire of sunrise and it seemed to me i could feel the wind and way up in the tree was a tiny girl looking off into the distance her cheeks flushed with wind with joy with magic dont cry julianna i want it to help you not hurt you i wiped the tears from my cheeks and gave a mighty sniff thank you daddy i choked out thank you i hung the painting across the room from my bed its the first thing i see every morning and the last thing i see every night and now that i can look at it without crying i see more than the tree and what being up in its branches meant to me i see the day that my view of things around me started changing brawkbrawkbrawk eggs scare me chickens too and buddy you can laugh at that all you want but im being dead serious here it started in the sixth grade with eggs and a snake and the baker brothers the baker brothers names are matt and mike but even now i cant tell you which ones which you never see one without the other and even though theyre not twins they do look and sound pretty much the same and theyre both in lynettas class so maybe one of them got held back although i cant exactly see a teacher voluntarily having either of those maniacs two years in a row regardless matt and mike are the ones who taught me that snakes eat eggs and when i say they eat eggs im talking they eat them raw and shellon whole i probably wouldve gone my entire life without this little bit of reptilian trivia if it hadnt been for lynetta lynetta had this majorleague thing for skyler brown who lives about three blocks down and every chance she got she went down there to hang out while he practiced the drums well boomboomwhap what did i care right but then skyler and julis brothers formed a band which they named mystery pisser when my mom heard about it she completely wigged out what kind of parents would allow their children to be in a band named mystery pisser its vile its disgusting thats the whole point mom lynetta tried to explain it doesnt mean anything its just to get a rise out of old people are you calling me old young lady because its certainly getting a rise out of me lynetta just shrugged implying that my mom could draw her own conclusion go go to your room my mother snapped for what lynetta snapped back i didnt say a thing you know perfectly well what for now you go in there and adjust your attitude young lady so lynetta got another one of her teenage timeouts and after that any time lynetta was two minutes late coming home for dinner my mother would messenger me down to skylers house to drag her home it might have been embarrassing for lynetta but it was worse for me i was still in elementary school and the mystery pisser guys were in high school they were ripe and ragged raging power chords through the neighborhood while i looked like id just gotten back from sunday school id get so nervous going down there that my voice would squeak when id tell lynetta it was time for dinner it literally squeaked but after a while the band dropped mystery from their name and pisser and its entourage got used to me showing up and instead of glaring at me they started saying stuff like hey baby brother come on in hey brycie boy wanna jam this then is how i wound up in skyler browns garage surrounded by high school kids watching a boa constrictor swallow eggs since id already seen it down a rat in the baker brothers bedroom pisser had lost at least some of the element of surprise plus i picked up on the fact that theyd been saving this little show to freak me out and i really didnt want to give them the satisfaction this wasnt easy though because watching a snake swallow an egg is actually much creepier than you might think the boa opened its mouth to an enormous size then just took the egg in and glub we could see it roll down its throat but that wasnt all after the snake had glubbed down three eggs mattormike said so brycie boy hows he gonna digest those i shrugged and tried not to squeak when i answered stomach acid he shook his head and pretended to confide he needs a tree or a leg he grinned at me wanna volunteer yours i backed away a little i could just see that monster try to swallow my leg whole as an after egg chaser nno he laughed and pointed at the boa slithering across the room aw too bad hes going the other way hes gonna use the piano instead the piano what kind of snake was this how could my sister stand being in the same room as these dementos i looked at her and even though she was pretending to be cool with the snake i know lynetta she was totally creeped out by it the snake wrapped itself around the piano leg about three times and then mattormike put his hands up and said shhh shhh everybody quiet here goes the snake stopped moving then flexed and
Document 14
as it flexed we could hear the eggs crunch inside him oh gross the girls wailed whoa dude the guys all said mike and matt smiled at each other real big and said dinner is served i tried to act cool about the snake but the truth is i started having bad dreams about the thing swallowing eggs and rats and cats and me then the reallife nightmare began one morning about two weeks after the boa show in skylers garage juli appears on our doorstep and whats she got in her hands a halfcarton of eggs she bounces around like its christmas saying hiya bryce remember abby and bonnie and clyde and dexter eunice and florence i just stared at her somehow i remembered santas reindeer a little different than that you know my chickens the ones i hatched for the science fair last year oh right how could i forget theyre laying eggs she pushed the carton into my hands here take these theyre for you and your family oh uh thanks i said and closed the door i used to really like eggs especially scrambled with bacon or sausage but even without the little snake incident i knew that no matter what you did to these eggs they would taste nothing but foul to me these eggs came from the chickens that had been the chicks that had hatched from the eggs that had been incubated by juli baker for our fifthgrade science fair it was classic juli she totally dominated the fair and get this her project was all about watching eggs my friend there is not a lot of action to report on when youre incubating eggs youve got your light youve got your container youve got some shredded newspaper and thats it youre done juli though managed to write an inchthick report plus she made diagrams and charts im talking line charts and bar charts and pie charts about the activity of eggs eggs she also managed to time the eggs so that theyd hatch the night of the fair how does a person do that here ive got a liveaction erupting volcano that ive worked pretty stinking hard on and all anybody cares about is julis chicks pecking out of their shells i even went over to take a look for myself and im being completely objective here it was boring they pecked for about five seconds then just lay there for five minutes i got to hear juli jabber away to the judges too she had a pointer can you believe that not a pencil an actual retractable pointer so she could reach across her incubator and tap on this chart or that diagram as she explained the excitement of watching eggs grow for twentyone days the only thing she couldve done to be more overboard was put on a chicken costume and buddy im convinced if shed thought of it she would have done it but hey i was over it it was just juli being juli right but all of a sudden there i am a year later holding a carton of homegrown eggs and im having a hard time not getting annoyed all over again about her stupid blueribbon project when my mother leans out from the hallway and says who was that honey what have you got there eggs i could tell by the look on her face that she was hot to scramble yeah i said and handed them to her but im having cereal she opened the carton then closed it with a smile how nice she said who brought them over juli she grew them grew them well her chickens did oh her smile started falling as she opened the carton again is that so i didnt know she had chickens remember you and dad spent an hour watching them hatch at last years science fair well how do we know therere not chicks inside these eggs i shrugged like i said im having cereal we all had cereal but what we talked about were eggs my dad thought theyd be just fine hed had farmfresh eggs when he was a kid and said they were delicious my mother though couldnt get past the idea that she might be cracking open a dead chick and pretty soon discussion turned to the role of the rooster something me and my cheerios couldve done without finally lynetta said if they had a rooster dont you think wed know dont you think the whole neighborhood would know hmmm we all said good point but then my mom pipes up with maybe they got it de yodeled you know like they debark dogs a deyodeled rooster my dad says like its the most ridiculous thing hes ever heard then he looks at my mom and realizes that hed be way better off going along with her deyodeled idea than making fun of her hmmm he says ive never heard of such a thing but maybe so lynetta shrugs and says to my mom so just ask them why dont you call up mrs baker and ask her oh my mom says well id hate to call her eggs into question it doesnt seem very polite now does it just ask matt or mike i say to lynetta she scowls at me and hisses shut up what whatd i do now havent you noticed i havent been going down there you idiot lynetta my mom says like this is the first time shes heard my sister talk to me or something well its true how can he not have noticed i was going to ask you about that honey did something happen lynetta stands up and shoves her chair in like you care she snaps and charges

soon the yards full of birds and all we can see of juli is her poopcovered shoes thats not all we can hear though shes warbling inside that coop going i dont need money no fortune or faaayayame i got all the riches baby anyone can claim well i guess youd say what can make me feel this way my girls talkin bout my little girurrls my girls at this point i wasnt checking the chickens out for rubbery red stuff or feathers i was looking at the bottom of juli bakers feet wondering how in the world a person could be so happy tunneling through a dilapidated chicken coop with poop stuck all over her shoes garrett got me back on track theyre all chickens he says look at em i quit checking out julis shoes and started checking out birds the first thing i did was count them onetwothreefourfivesix all accounted for after all how could anyone forget shed hatched six it was the alltime school record everyone in the county had heard about that but i was not really sure how to ask garrett about what he had said yeah they were all chickens but what did that mean i sure didnt want him coming down on me again but it still didnt make sense finally i asked him you mean theres no rooster correctomundo how can you tell he shrugged roosters strut strut thats right and look none of them have long feathers or very much of that rubbery red stuff he nodded yeah theyre definitely all chickens that night my father got right to the point so son mission accomplished he asked as he stabbed into a mountain of fettuccine and whirled his fork around i attacked my noodles too and gave him a smile uhhuh i said as i sat up tall to deliver the news theyre all chickens the turning of his fork came to a grinding halt and i could tell something was wrong but i didnt know what i tried to keep the smile plastered on my face as i said and what he rested his fork and stared at me is that what she said theyre all chickens uh not exactly then exactly what did she say uh she didnt exactly say anything meaning meaning i went over there and took a look for myself i tried very hard to sound like this was a major accomplishment but he wasnt buying you didnt ask her i didnt have to garrett knows a lot about chickens and we went over there and found out for ourselves lynetta came back from rinsing the romano sauce off her seven and a half noodles then reached for the salt and scowled at me saying youre the chicken lynetta my mother said be nice lynetta stopped shaking the salt mother he spied you get it he went over there and looked over the fence are you saying youre okay with that my mom turned to me bryce is that true everyone was staring at me now and i felt like i had to save face whats the big deal you told me to find out about her chickens and i found out about her chickens brawkbrawkbrawk my sister whispered my father still wasnt eating and what you found out he said like he was measuring every word was that theyre all chickens right he sighed then took that bite of noodles and chewed it for the longest time it felt like i was sinking fast but i couldnt figure out why so i tried to bail out with and you guys can go ahead and eat those eggs but theres no way im going to touch them so dont even ask my mothers looking back and forth from my dad to me while she eats her salad and i can tell shes waiting for him to address my adventure as a neighborhood operative but since hes not saying anything she clears her throat and says whys that because theres well theres i dont know how to say this nicely just say it my father snaps well theres you know excrement everywhere oh gross my sister says throwing down her fork you mean chicken droppings my mother asks yeah theres not even a lawn its all dirt and uh you know chicken turds the chickens walk in it and peck through it and oh gross lynetta wails well its true lynetta stands up and says you expect me to eat after this and stalks out of the room lynetta you have to eat something my mother calls after her no i dont she shouts back then a second later she sticks her head back into the dining room and says and dont expect me to eat any of those eggs either mother does the word salmonella mean anything to you lynetta takes off down the hall and my mother says salmonella she turns to my father do you suppose they could have salmonella i dont know patsy im more concerned that our son is a coward a coward rick please bryce is no such thing hes a wonderful child whos whos afraid of a girl dad im not afraid of her she just bugs me why you know why she bugs you too shes over the top about everything bryce i asked you to conquer your fear but all you did was give in to it if you were in love with her that would be one thing love is something to be afraid of but this this is embarrassing so she talks too much so shes too enthused about every little thing so what get in get your question answered and get out stand up to her for cryin out loud rick my mom was saying rick calm down he did find out what you asked him to no he didnt what do you mean he tells me theyre all chickens of course theyre all

chickens the question is how many are hens and how many are roosters i could almost hear the click in my brain and man i felt like a complete doofus no wonder he was disgusted with me i was an idiot they were all chickens duuh garrett acted like he was some expert on chickens and he didnt know diddlysquat why had i listened to him but it was too late my dad was convinced i was a coward and to get me over it he decided that what i should do was take the carton of eggs back to the bakers and tell them we didnt eat eggs or that we were allergic to them or something then my mom butts in with what are you teaching him here rick none of that is true if he returns them shouldnt he tell them the truth what that youre afraid of salmonella poisoning me arent you a little concerned too patsy thats not the point the point is i will not have a coward for a son but teaching him to lie fine then just throw them away but from now on i expect you to look that little tiger square in the eye you hear me yes sir okay then i was off the hook for all of about eight days then there she was again at seven in the morning bouncing up and down on our porch with eggs in her hands hi bryce here you go i tried to look her square in the eye and tell her no thanks but she was so darned happy and i wasnt really awake enough to tackle the tiger she wound up pushing another carton into my hands and i wound up ditching them in the kitchen trash before my father sat down to breakfast this went on for two years two years and it got to a point where it was just part of my morning routine id be on the lookout for juli so i could whip the door open before she had the chance to knock or ring the bell and then id bury the eggs in the trash before my dad showed up then came the day i blew it julid actually been making herself pretty scarce because it was around the time theyd taken the sycamore tree down but suddenly one morning she was back on our doorstep delivering eggs i took them as usual and i went to chuck them as usual but the kitchen trash was so full that there wasnt any room for the carton so i put it on top picked up the trash and beat it out the front door to empty everything into the garbage can outside well guess whos just standing there like a statue on my porch the egg chick i about spilled the trash all over the porch what are you still doing here i asked her ii dont know i was just thinking about what i was desperate i needed a distraction some way around her with this garbage before she noticed what was sitting right there on topshe looked away like she was embarrassed juli baker embarrassed i didnt think it was possible whatever the golden opportunity to whip a soggy magazine over the egg carton had presented itself and buddy i took it then i tried to make a fast break for the garbage can in the side yard only she bodyblocked me seriously she stepped right in my way and put her arms out like shes guarding the goal she chased me and blocked me again what happened she wants to know did they break perfect why hadnt i thought of that yeah juli i told her and im real sorry about that but what im thinking is please god oh please god let me make it to the garbage can god mustve been sleeping in juli tackled the trash and pulled out her precious little carton of eggs and she could tell right off that they werent broken they werent even cracked she stood frozen with the eggs in her hands while i dumped the rest of the trash why did you throw them out she asked but her voice didnt sound like juli bakers voice it was quiet and shaky so i told her we were afraid of salmonella poisoning because her yard was a mess and that we were just trying to spare her feelings i told it to her like we were right and she was wrong but i felt like a jerk a complete cluckfaced jerk then she tells me that a couple of neighbors have been buying eggs off her buying them and while im coming to grips with this incredible bit of news she whips out her mental calculator do you realize ive lost over a hundred dollars giving these eggs to you then she races across the street in a flood of tears as much as i tried to tell myself that i hadnt asked her for the eggsi hadnt said we wanted them or needed them or liked themthe fact was id never seen juli cry before not when shed broken her arm in pe not when shed been teased at school or ditched by her brothers not even when theyd cut down the sycamore tree im pretty sure she cried then but i didnt actually see it to me juli baker had always been too tough to cry i went down to my room to pack my stuff for school feeling like the biggest jerk to ever hit the planet id been sneaking around throwing out eggs for over two years avoiding her avoiding my father what did that make me why hadnt i just stood up and said no thanks dont want em dont need em dont like em give them to the snake why dont you something was i really afraid of hurting her feelings or was i afraid of

her the eggs after they cut down the sycamore tree it seemed like everything else fell apart too champ died and then i found out about the eggs it was champs time to go and even though i still miss him i think its been easier for me to deal with his death than it has been for me to deal with the truth about the eggs i still cannot believe it about the eggs the eggs came before the chickens in our case but the dog came before them both one night when i was about six years old dad came home from work with a fullgrown dog tied down in the back of his truck someone had hit it in the middle of an intersection and dad had stopped to see how badly it was hurt then he noticed that the poor thing was skinny as a rail and didnt have any tags starving and completely disoriented he told my mother can you imagine someone abandoning their dog like that the whole family had converged on the front porch and i could hardly contain myself a dog a wonderful happy panty dog i realize now that champ was never much of a looker but when youre six any dogno matter how mangy is a glorious huggable creature he looked pretty good to my brothers too but from the way my mothers face was pinched i could tell she was thinking abandon this dog oh i can see it i can definitely see it what she said though was simply there is no room for that animal in this house trina my dad said its not a matter of ownership its a matter of compassion youre not springing it on me as a a pet then that is definitely not my intention well then what do you intend to do give him a decent meal a bath then maybe well place an ad and find him a home she eyed him from across the threshold therell be no maybe about it my brothers said we dont get to keep him thats right but moom they moaned its not open to discussion she said he gets a bath he gets a meal he gets an ad in the paper my father put one arm around matts shoulder and the other around mikes someday boys well get a puppy my mother was already heading back inside but over her shoulder came not until you learn to keep your room neat boys by the end of the week the dog was named champ by the end of the next week hed made it from the backyard into the kitchen area and not too long after that he was all moved in it seemed nobody wanted a fullgrown dog with a happy bark nobody but fourfifths of the baker family anyway then my mother started noticing an odor a mysterious odor of indeterminate origin we all admitted we smelled it too but where my mother was convinced it was eau de champ we disagreed she had us bathing him so often that it couldnt possibly be him we each sniffed him out pretty good and he smelled perfectly rosy my personal suspicion was that matt and mike were the ones not bathing enough but i didnt want to get close enough to sniff them and since our camp was divided on just who the culprit or culprits were the odor was dubbed the mystery smell whole dinnertime discussions revolved around the mystery smell which my brothers found amusing and my mother did not then one day my mother cracked the case and she might have cracked champs skull as well if my dad hadnt come to the rescue and shooed him outside mom was fuming i told you it was him the mystery smell comes from the mystery pisser did you see that did you see that he just squirted on the end table my father raced with a roll of paper towels to where champ had been and said where where is it all of three drops were dripping down the table leg there my mother said pointing a shaky finger at the wetness there dad wiped it up then checked the carpet and said it was barely a drop exactly my mother said with her hands on her hips which is why ive never been able to find anything that dog stays outside from now on do you hear me he is no longer allowed in this house how about the garage i asked can he sleep in there and have him tag everything thats out there no mike and matt were grinning at each other mystery pisser that could be the name for our band yeah cool band my mother asked wait a minute what band but they were already flying down to their room laughing about the possibilities for a logo my father and i spent the rest of the day sniffing out and destroying criminal evidence my dad used a spray bottle of ammonia i followed up with lysol we did try to recruit my brothers but they wound up getting into a spraybottle fight which got them locked in their room which of course was fine with them so champ became an outside dog and he might have been our only pet ever if it hadnt been for my fifthgrade science fair everyone around me had great project ideas but i couldnt seem to come up with one then our teacher mrs brubeck took me aside and told me about a friend of hers who had chickens and how she could get me a fertilized egg for my project but i dont know anything about hatching an egg i told her she smiled and put her arm around my shoulders you dont have to be an immediate expert at everything juli the idea here is to learn something new but what if it dies then it dies

document your work scientifically and youll still get an a if thats what youre worried about an a being responsible for the death of a baby chickthats what i was worried about suddenly there was real appeal in building a volcano or making my own neoprene or demonstrating the various scientific applications of gear ratios but the ball was in motion and mrs brubeck would have no more discussion about it she pulled the beginners guide to raising chickens from her bookshelf and said read the section on artificial incubation and set yourself up tonight ill get you an egg tomorrow but dont worry so much juli she said we do this every year and its always one of the best projects at the fair i said but but she was gone off to put an end to some other students battle with indecision that night i was more worried than ever id read the chapter on incubation at least four times and was still confused about where to start i didnt happen to have an old aquarium lying around we didnt happen to have an incubation thermometer would a deepfry model work i was supposed to control humidity too or horrible things would happen to the chick too dry and the chick couldnt peck out too wet and it would die of mushy chick disease mushy chick disease my mother being the sensible person that she is told me to tell mrs brubeck that i simply wouldnt be hatching a chick have you considered growing beans she asked me my father however understood that you cant refuse to do your teachers assignment and he promised to help an incubators not difficult to build well make one after dinner how my father knows exactly where things are in our garage is one of the wonders of the universe how he knew about incubators however was revealed to me while he was drilling a oneinch hole in an old scrap of plexiglas i raised a duck from an egg when i was in high school he grinned at me science fair project a duck yes but the principle is the same for all poultry keep the temperature constant and the humidity right turn the egg several times a day and in a few weeks youll have yourself a little peeper he handed me a lightbulb and an extension cord with a socket attached fasten this through the hole in the plexiglas ill find some thermometers some we need more than one we have to make you a hygrometer a hygrometer to check the humidity inside the incubator its just a thermometer with wet gauze around the bulb i smiled no mushy chick disease he smiled back precisely by the next afternoon i had not one but six chicken eggs incubating at a cozy degrees fahrenheit they dont all make it juli mrs brubeck told me hope for one the records three the grades in the documentation be a scientist good luck and with that she was off documentation of what i had to turn the eggs three times a day and regulate the temperature and humidity but aside from that what was there to do that night my father came out to the garage with a cardboard tube and a flashlight he taped the two together so that the light beam was forced straight out the tube let me show you how to candle an egg he said then switched off the garage light id seen a section on candling eggs in mrs brubecks book but i hadnt really read it yet why do they call it that i asked him and why do you do it people used candles to do this before they had incandescent lighting he held an egg up to the cardboard tube the light lets you see through the shell so you can watch the embryo develop then you can cull the weak ones if necessary kill them cull them remove the ones that dont develop properly but wouldnt that also kill them he looked at me leaving an egg you should cull might have disastrous results on the healthy ones why wouldnt it just not hatch he went back to lighting up the egg it might explode and contaminate the other eggs with bacteria explode between mushy chick disease exploding eggs and culling this project was turning out to be the worst then my father said look here julianna you can see the embryo he held the flashlight and egg out so i could see i looked inside and he said see the dark spot there in the middle with all the veins leading to it the thing that looks like a bean thats it suddenly it felt real this egg was alive i quickly checked the rest of the group there were little bean babies in all of them surely they had to live surely they would all make it dad can i take the incubator inside it might get too cold out here at night dont you think i was going to suggest the same thing why dont you prop open the door ill carry it for you for the next two weeks i was completely consumed with the growing of chicks i labeled the eggs a b c d e and f but before long they had names too abby bonnie clyde dexter eunice and florence every day i weighed them candled them and turned them i even thought it might be good for them to hear some clucking so for a while i did that too but clucking is tiring it was much easier to hum around my quiet little flock so i did that instead soon i was humming without even thinking about it because when i was around my eggs i was happy i read the beginners guide to raising chickens cover to cover twice for my project i drew diagrams of the various stages of an embryos development

i made a giant chicken poster i graphed the daily fluctuations in temperature and humidity and i made a line chart documenting the weight loss of each egg on the outside eggs were boring but i knew what was happening on the inside then two days before the science fair i was candling bonnie when i noticed something i called my dad into my room and said look dad look at this is that the heart beating he studied it for a moment then smiled and said let me get your mother so the three of us crowded around and watched bonnies heart beat and even my mother had to admit that it was absolutely amazing clyde was the first to pip and of course he did it right before i had to leave for school his little beak cracked through and while i held my breath and waited he rested and rested finally his beak poked through again but almost right away he rested again how could i go to school and just leave him this way what if he needed my help surely this was a valid reason to stay home at least for a little while my father tried to assure me that hatching out could take all day and that thered be plenty of action left after school but id have none of that oh nonono i wanted to see abby and bonnie and clyde and dexter and eunice and florence come into the world every single one of them i cant miss the hatch i told him not even a second of it so take it to school with you my mother said mrs brubeck shouldnt mind after all this was her idea sometimes it pays to have a sensible mother id just set up for the science fair early thats what id do i packed up my entire operation posters charts and all and got a ride to school from my mom mrs brubeck didnt mind a bit she was so busy helping kids with their projects that i got to spend nearly the entire day watching the hatch clyde and bonnie were the first ones out it was disappointing at first because they just lay there all wet and matted looking exhausted and ugly but by the time abby and dexter broke out bonnie and clyde were fluffing up looking for action the last two took forever but mrs brubeck insisted that i leave them alone and that worked out pretty great because they hatched out during the fair that night my whole family came and even though matt and mike only watched for about two minutes before they took off to look at some other demonstration my mom and dad stuck around for the whole thing mom even picked bonnie up and nuzzled her that night after it was all over and i was packing up to go home mom asked so do these go back to mrs brubeck now do what go back to mrs brubeck i asked her the chicks juli youre not planning to raise chickens are you to be honest i hadnt thought beyond the hatch my focus had been strictly on bringing them into the world but she was righthere they were six fluffy little adorable chicks each of which had a name and i could already tell its own unique personality ii dont know i stammered ill ask mrs brubeck i tracked down mrs brubeck but i was praying that she didnt want me to give them back to her friend after all id hatched them id named them id saved them from mushy chick disease these little peepers were mine to my relief and my mothers horror mrs brubeck said they were indeed mine all mine have fun she said then zipped off to help heidi dismantle her exhibit on bernoullis law mom was quiet the whole way home and i could tellshe wanted chickens like she wanted a tractor and a goat please mom i whispered as we parked at the curb please she covered her face where are we going to raise chickens juli where in the backyard i didnt know what else to suggest what about champ theyll get along mom ill teach him i promise my dad said softly theyre pretty selfsufficient trina but then the boys piped up with champll piss em to death mom and suddenly they were on a roll yeah but you wont even notice cause theyre yellow already whoa yellow alreadycool name that could work but wait people might think we mean our bellies oh yeah forget that yeah just let him kill the chicks my brothers looked at each other with enormous eyes and started up all over again kill the chicks thats it get it you mean like were chick killers or like we kill the chicks dad turned around and said out both of you get out go find a name elsewhere so they scrambled out and the three of us sat in the car with only the gentle peeppeep peep from my little flock breaking the silence finally my mother heaved a heavy sigh and said they dont cost much to keep do they my dad shook his head they eat bugs trina and a little feed theyre very low maintenance bugs really what sort of bugs earwigs worms rolypolys probably spiders if they can catch them i think they eat snails too seriously my mother smiled well in that case oh thank you mom thank you and thats how we wound up with chickens what none of us thought of was that six chickens scratching for bugs not only gets rid of bugs it also tears up grass within six months there was nothing whatsoever left of our yard what we also didnt think of was that chicken feed attracts mice and mice attract cats feral cats champ was pretty good at keeping the cats out of the yard but theyd

hang around the front yard or the side yard just waiting for him to snooze so they could sneak in and pounce on some tender little mousy vittles then my brothers started trapping the mice which i thought was just to help out i didnt suspect a thing until the day i heard my mother screaming from the depths of their room they were it turns out raising a boa constrictor moms foot came down in a big way and i thought she was going to throw us out lock stock and boa but then i made the most amazing discoverychickens lay eggs beautiful shiny creamy white eggs i first found one under bonnie then clydewhom i immediately renamed clydetteand one more in florences bed eggs i raced inside to show my mom and after a brief moment of blinking at them she withered into a chair no she whimpered no more chicks theyre not chicks mom theyre eggs she was still looking quite pale so i sat in the chair next to her and said we dont have a rooster oh the color was coming back to her cheeks is that so ive never heard a cockadoodledo have you she laughed blessing i guess ive forgotten to count she sat up a little and took an egg from my palm eggs huh how many do you suppose theyll lay i have no idea as it turns out my hens laid more eggs than we could eat at first we tried to keep up but soon we were tired of boiling and pickling and deviling and my mother started complaining that all these free eggs were costing her way too much then one afternoon as i was collecting eggs our neighbor mrs stueby leaned over the side fence and said if you ever have any extra id be happy to buy them from you really i asked most certainly nothing quite like freerange eggs two dollars a dozen sound fair to you two dollars a dozen i laughed and said sure okay then whenever you have some extras just bring em over mrs helms and i got to discussing it last night on the phone but i asked you first so make sure you offer em up to me before her okay juli sure thing mrs stueby between mrs stueby and mrs helms three doors down my egg overflow problem was solved and maybe i shouldve turned the money over to my mother as payment for having destroyed the backyard but one nonsense julianna its yours was all it took for me to start squirreling it away then one day as i was walking down to mrs helms house mrs loski drove by she waved and smiled and i realized with a pang of guilt that i wasnt being very neighborly about my eggs she didnt know that mrs helms and mrs stueby were paying me for these eggs she probably thought i was delivering them out of the kindness of my heart and maybe i shouldve been giving the eggs away but id never had a steady income before allowance at our house is a hitormiss sort of thing usually a miss and earning money from my eggs gave me this secret happy feeling which i was reluctant to have the kindness of my heart encroach upon but the more i thought about it the more i realized that mrs loski deserved some free eggs she had been a good neighbor to us lending us supplies when we ran out unexpectedly and being late to work herself when my mother needed a ride because our car wouldnt start a few eggs now and again it was the least i could do there was also the decidedly blissful possibility of running into bryce and in the chilly sparkle of a new day bryces eyes seemed bluer than ever the way he looked at methe smile the blushit was a bryce i didnt get to see at school the bryce at school was way more protected by the third time i brought eggs over to the loskis i realized that bryce was waiting for me waiting to pull the door open and say thanks juli and then see you at school it was worth it even after mrs helms and mrs stueby offered me more money per dozen it was still worth it so through the rest of sixth grade through all of seventh grade and most of eighth i delivered eggs to the loskis the very best shiniest eggs went straight to the loskis and in return i got a few moments alone with the worlds most dazzling eyes it was a bargain then they cut down the sycamore tree and two weeks later champ died hed been spending a lot of time sleeping and even though we didnt really know how old he was no one was really surprised when one night dad went out to feed him and discovered he was dead we buried him in the backyard and my brothers put up a cross that reads here lies the mystery pisser pip i was upset and pretty dazed for a while it was raining a lot and i was riding my bike to school to avoid having to take the bus and each day when id get home id retreat to my room lose myself in a novel and simply forget about collecting eggs mrs stueby was the one who got me back on schedule she called to say shed read about the tree in the paper and was sorry about everything that had happened but it had been some time now and she missed her eggs and was worried that my hens might quit laying distress can push a bird straight into a molting and we wouldnt want that feathers everywhere and not an egg in sight im quite allergic to the feathers myself or id probably have a flock of my own but never you

Document 23
saying stuff like no you dont you are coming off whether you like it or not did i feel good about this no my friend i did not yeah their yard was a mess and it was about time someone did something about it but cmon wheres the dad what about matt and mike why juli because id embarrassed her into it thats why i felt worse than ever so i snuck inside and tried to ignore the fact that heres my desk and heres my window and right across the street from me is juli beating up a bush not conducive to concentration no siree bob i got all of zero homework done the next day at school i was trying to get up the nerve to say something to her but i never even got the chance she wouldnt let me get anywhere near her then on the ride home i had this thought it kind of freaked me out at first but the more i played with it the more i figured that yeah helping her with the yard would make up for my having been such a jerk assuming she didnt boss me too much and assuming she didnt decide to get all gooeyeyed or something stupid like that no id go up and just tell her that i felt bad for being a jerk and i wanted to make it up to her by helping her cut back some bushes period end of story and if she still wanted to be mad at me after that then fine that was her problem my problem was i never got the chance i came trekking down from the bus stop to find my grandfather doing my good deed now jump back this was not something i could immediately absorb my grandfather did not do yard work at least hed never offered to help me out my grandfather lived in house slippers whered he get those work boots and those jeans and that flannel shirt what was up with those i crouched behind a neighbors hedge and watched them for ten or fifteen minutes and man the longer i watched the madder i got my grandfather had already said more to her in this little slice of time than hed said to me the whole year and a half hed been living with us what was his deal with juli baker i took the back way home which involved climbing two fences and kicking off the neighbors stupid little terrier but it was worth it considering i avoided the garden party across the street again i got no homework done the more i watched them the madder i got i was still a cluckfaced jerk while juli was laughing it up with my grandfather had i ever seen him smile really smile i dont think so but now he was knee high in nettles laughing at dinner that night hed showered and changed back into his regular clothes and house slippers but he didnt look the same it was like someone had plugged him in and turned on the light good evening he said as he sat down with the rest of us oh patsy that looks delicious well dad my mom said with a laugh your excursion across the street seems to have done you a world of good yeah my father said patsy tells me youve been over there all afternoon if you were in the mood for home improvement projects why didnt you just say so my father was just joking around but i dont think my grandfather took it that way he helped himself to a cheesestuffed potato and said pass the salt wont you bryce so there was this definite tension between my father and my grandfather but i think if dad had dropped the subject right then the vibe wouldve vanished dad didnt drop it though instead he said so whys the girl the one whos finally doing something about their place my grandfather salted his potato very carefully then looked across the table at me ahoh i thought ah oh in a flash i knew those stupid eggs were not behind me two years of sneaking them in the trash two years of avoiding discussion of juli and her eggs and her chickens and her earlymorning visits and for what granddad knew i could see it in his eyes in a matter of seconds hed crack open the truth and id be as good as fried enter a miracle my grandfather petrified me for a minute with his eyes but then turned to my father and said she wants to is all a raging river of sweat ran down my temples and as my father said well its about time someone did my grandfather looked back at me and i knewhe was not going to let me forget this wed just had another conversation only this time i was definitely not dismissed after the dishes were cleared i retreated to my room but my grandfather came right in closed the door behind him and then sat on my bed he did this all without making a sound no squeaking no clanking no scraping no breathing i swear the guy moved through my room like a ghost and of course im banging my knee and dropping my pencil and deteriorating into a pathetic pool of jello but i tried my best to sound cool as i said hello granddad come to check out the digs he pinched his lips together and looked at nothing but me i cracked look granddad i know i messed up i shouldve just told her but i couldnt and i kept thinking theyd stop i mean how long can a chicken lay eggs those things hatched in the fifth grade that was like three years ago dont they eventually run out and what was i supposed to do tell her mom was afraid of salmonella poisoning and
Document 24
dad wanted me to tell her we were allergiccmon whos going to buy that so i just kept you know throwing them out i didnt know she couldve sold them i thought they were just extras he was nodding but very slowly i sighed and said thank you for not saying anything about it at dinner i owe you he pulled my curtain aside and looked across the street ones character is set at an early age son the choices you make now will affect you for the rest of your life he was quiet for a minute then dropped the curtain and said i hate to see you swim out so far you cant swim back yes sir he frowned and said dont yessir me bryce then he stood and added just think about what ive said and the next time youre faced with a choice do the right thing it hurts everyone less in the long run with that poof he was gone the next day i went to shoot some hoops at garretts after school and when his mom dropped me off later that afternoon my granddad didnt even notice he was too busy being joe carpenter in julis front yard i tried to do my homework at the breakfast bar but my mom came home from work and started being all chatty and then lynetta appeared and the two of them started fighting about whether lynettas makeup made her look like a wounded raccoon lynetta i swear shell never learn i packed up my stuff and escaped to my room which of course was a total waste theyve got a saw revving and wailing across the street and in between cuts i can hear the whack whack whack whack whack whack of a hammer i look out the window and theres juli spitting out nails and slamming them in place no kidding shes got nails lined up between her lips like steel cigarettes and shes swinging that hammer fullarc way above her head driving nails into pickets like theyre going into butter for a split second there i saw my head as the recipient of her hammer cracking open like humpty dumpty i shuddered and dropped the curtain ditched the homework and headed for the tv they handymanned all week and every night granddad would come in with rosy cheeks and a huge appetite and compliment my mom on what a great cook she was then saturday happened and the last thing i wanted was to spend the day at home while my grandfather churned up dirt and helped plant julis yard mom tried to get me to do our own yard but i would have felt ridiculous micromowing our grass with granddad and juli making real changes right across the street so i locked myself in my room and called garrett he wasnt home and everybody else i called had stuff they had to do and hitting up mom or dad for a ride to the movies or the mall was hopeless theyd tell me i was supposed to be doing the yard what i was was stuck and what i wound up doing was looking out the stupid window at juli and my grandfather it was a totally lame thing to do but thats what i did i got nailed doing it too by my grandfather and he of course had to point me out to juli which made me feel another two inches shorter i dropped the curtain and blasted out the back door and over the fence i had to get out of there i swear i walked ten miles that day and i dont know who i was madder at my grandfather juli or me what was wrong with me if i wanted to make it up to juli why didnt i just go over there and help what was stopping me i wound up at garretts house and man id never been so glad to see anyone in my life leave it to garrett to get your mind off anything important that dudes the master we went out back and shot hoops watched the tube and talked about hitting the water slides this summer and when i got home there was juli sprinkling the yard she saw me all right but she didnt wave or smile or anything she just looked away normally what id do in that situation is maybe pretend like i hadnt seen her or give a quick wave and charge inside but shed been mad at me for what seemed like ages she hadnt said word one to me since the morning of the eggs shed completely dissed me in math a couple days before when id smiled at her trying to tell her i was sorry she didnt smile back or nod or anything she just turned away and never looked back i even waited for her outside the classroom to say something anything about her fixing up the yard and how bad i felt but she ditched me out the other door and after that anytime i got anywhere near her shed find some way to skate around me so there she was watering the yard making me feel like a jerk and id had enough of it i went up to her and said its looking real good juli nice job thanks she said without smiling chet did most of it chet i thought chet what was she doing calling my grandfather by his first name look juli i said trying to get on with why i was there im sorry for what i did she looked at me for a second then went back to watching the water spray across the dirt finally she said i still dont get it bryce why didnt you just tell me ii dont know it was dumb i should have and i shouldnt have said anything about the yard either it was you know out of

line i was already feeling better a lot better then juli says well maybe its all for the better and starts bouncing up and down on the balls of her feet acting more like her old self doesnt it look great i learned so much from chet its amazing you are so lucky i dont even have grandparents anymore oh i said not knowing what to say i do feel sorry for him though he sure misses your grandmother then she laughs and shakes her head saying can you believe it he says i remind him of her what yeah she laughs again thats what i said but he meant it in a nice way i looked at juli and tried to picture my grandmother as an eighth grader it was hopeless i mean julis got long fluffy brown hair and a nose full of freckles where my grandmother had always been some variety of blond and my grandmother had used powder puffy white powder shed put it on her face and in her hair in her slippers and on her chest that woman powdered everything i could not see juli coated in powder okay maybe gun powder but the white perfumy stuff forget it i guess i was staring because juli says look i didnt say it he did i just thought it was nice thats all yeah whatever well good luck with the grass im sure itll come up great then i totally surprised myself by saying knowing you youll get em all to hatch i didnt say it mean or anything i really meant it i laughed and then she laughed and thats how i left hersprinkling her soontobe sod smiling i hadnt been in such a good mood in weeks the eggs were finally behind me i was absolved relieved happy it took me a few minutes at the dinner table to realize that i was the only one who was lynetta had on her usual pout so that wasnt it but my fathers idea of saying hello was to lay into me about the lawn no sweat i told him ill do it tomorrow all that got me was a scowl then mom says to my granddad you tired tonight dad i hadnt even noticed him sitting there like a stone yeah my father tosses down the table at him that girl working you too hard my grandfather straightens his fork on his napkin and says that girl is named juli and no she isnt working me too hard as you so callously put it callous me my dad laughs and says developed quite a soft spot for that girl havent you even lynetta let her pout go for a minute these were fighting words and everyone knew it mom nudged dad with her foot but that only made things worse no patsy i want to know why your father has the energy and inclination to befriend a complete stranger when hes never done so much as toss a baseball around with his own grandson well yeah i thought but then i remembered i owed my grandfather owed him bigtime without thinking i said take it easy dad juli just reminds him of grandma everyone clammed up and stared at me so i looked at my grandfather and said uh isnt that right granddad he nodded and rearranged his fork some more of rene my father looked at my mother and then at granddad she cant possibly my granddad closed his eyes and said its her spirit that reminds me of rene her spirit my father says like hes talking to a lying kindergartner yes her spirit my grandfathers quiet for a minute then asks do you know why the bakers havent fixed up the yard until now why sure theyre trash thats why theyve got a beatup house two beatup cars and a beatup yard they are not trash rick they are good honest hardworking people who have absolutely no pride in how they present themselves to the rest of the world weve lived across the street from those people for over six years and there is no excuse for the state theyre in no my grandfather takes a deep breath and seems to weigh things in his mind for a few seconds then he says tell me this rick if you had a brother or sister or child who had a severe mental or physical handicap what would you do it was like my granddad had passed gas in church my fathers face pinched his head shook and finally he said chet what does that have to do with anything my grandfather looks at him for a minute then quietly says julis father has a retarded brother and my father interrupts him with a laugh well that explains a lot doesnt it explainsa lot my grandfather asks quietly calmly sure it explains why those people are the way they are he grins around the table at us must run in the family everyone looks at him lynettas jaw drops and for once shes speechless my mother says rick but all my father can do is laugh a nervous kind of laugh and say it was just a joke i mean obviously somethings wrong with those people oh excuse me chet i forgot the girl reminds you of rene rick my mother says again only this time shes mad oh patsy please your fathers being overly dramatic trying to make me feel bad for criticizing our neighbors because theres a retarded relative someplace other people have family troubles and still manage to mow their lawn they should have a little pride in ownership for cryin out loud my grandfathers cheeks are seriously flushed but his voice is rocksteady as he says they dont own that house rick the landlord is supposed to maintain the premises but he doesnt and since julis father is responsible for his brother all their reserves go to his care
Document 26
and obviously it doesnt come cheap very quietly my mom asks dont they have government facilities for that kind of thing i dont know the details patsy maybe there are no government facilities nearby maybe they thought a private facility was a better place for him to be still my dad says there are government facilities available and if they dont want to go that route thats their choice its not our fault their family had some sort of chromosomal abnormality and i refuse to feel guilty for wanting my grandfather slams his hand on the table and halfstands as he says it had nothing to do with chromosomes rick it was caused by a lack of oxygen at birth he brings his voice down but it makes his words seem even more forceful julis uncle had the umbilical cord wrapped around his neck twice one minute he was a perfect little baby just like your son bryce and the next he was irreversibly damaged my mother was suddenly hysterical in seconds she was bawling her eyes out wailing and my father was all over her trying to calm her down it was no use she basically dissolved right there on the spot lynetta threw her napkin down and muttered this family is a joke and took off then my mother bolted out of the room sobbing into her hands and my father raced after her throwing my grandfather the wickedest look id ever seen that left granddad and me and a table full of cold food wow i finally said i had no idea you still dont he told me what do you mean he sat there like granite for a minute then leaned across the table toward me and said why do you suppose that upset your mother so much ii dont know i gave a halfhearted grin and said because shes female he smiled but just barely no shes upset because she knows that she could very well be standing in mr bakers shoes right now i thought about it a minute and finally asked did her brother have the cord around his neck when he was born he shook his head well then he leaned forward even farther and whispered you did i did he nodded twice but the doctor who delivered you was on the ball plus apparently there was some slack in the cord so he was able to loop it off as you came out you didnt hang yourself coming into the world but it could very easily have gone the other way if id been told years or even weeks ago that id come down the chute noosed and ready to hang id have made some kind of joke about it or more likely id have said yeah thats nice now can you spare me the discussion but after everything that had happened i was really freaking out and i couldnt escape the questions tidalwaving my brain where would i be if things had been different what would they have done with me from the way my dad was talking he wouldnt have had much use for me thats for sure hed have stuck me in a nuthouse somewhere any where and forgotten about me but then i thought no im his kid he wouldnt do that would he i looked around at everything we had the big house the white carpet the antiques and artwork and stuff that was everywhere would they have given up all the stuff to make my life more pleasant i doubted it and man i doubted it bigtime id have been an embarrassment something to try to forget about how things looked had always been a biggie to my parents especially to my dad very quietly my granddad said you cant dwell on what might have been bryce then like he could read my mind he added and its not fair to condemn him for something he hasnt done i nodded and tried to get a grip but i wasnt doing a very good job of it then he said by the way i appreciated your comment before what i asked but my throat was feeling all pinched and swollen about your grandmother how did you know that i shook my head and said juli told me oh you spoke with her then yeah actually i apologized to her well and i was feeling a lot better about everything but now god i feel like such a jerk again dont you apologized and thats what matters he stood up and said say im in the mood for a walk want to join me go for a walk what i wanted to do was go to my room lock the door and be left alone i find it really helps to clear the mind he said and thats when i realized that this wasnt just a walk this was an invitation to do something together i stood up and said yeah lets get out of here for a guy whod only basically ever said pass the salt to me my granddad turned out to be a real talker we walked our neighborhood and the next neighborhood and the next neighborhood and not only did i find out that my granddad knows a lot of stuff i found out that the guy is funny in a subtle kind of dry way its the stuff he says plus the way he says it its really i dont know cool as we were winding back into our own territory we passed by the house thats going up where the sycamore tree used to be my granddad stopped looked up into the night and said it mustve been a spectacular view i looked up too and noticed for the first time that night that you could see the stars did you ever see her up there i asked him your mother pointed her out to me one time as we drove
Document 27
by it scared me to see her up so high but after i read the article i understood why she did it he shook his head the trees gone but shes still got the spark it gave her know what i mean luckily i didnt have to answer he just grinned and said some of us get dipped in flat some in satin some in gloss he turned to me but every once in a while you find someone whos iridescent and when you do nothing will ever compare as we walked up to our front porch my grandfather put his arm around my shoulder and said it was nice walking with you bryce i enjoyed myself very much me too i told him and we went inside right away we knew wed stepped into a war zone and even though no one was yelling or crying from the look on my parents faces i could tell thered been a major meltdown while my granddad and i were out granddad whispered to me ive got another fence to mend im afraid and headed into the dining room to talk to my parents i wanted nothing to do with that vibe i went straight to my room closed the door and flopped through the darkness onto my bed i lay there awhile and let the dinner disaster play through my mind and when id totally burned a fuse thinking about it i sat up and looked out the window there was a light on somewhere inside the bakers house and the streetlights were glowing but the night still seemed really dense like it was darker than usual and i dont know heavy i leaned closer to the window and looked up into the sky but i couldnt see the stars anymore i wondered if juli had ever been in the sycamore at night among the stars i shook my head flat glossy iridescent what was up with that juli baker had always seemed just plain dusty to me i snapped on my desk lamp and dug the newspaper with the article about juli out of the drawer where id tossed it just like i thought they made it sound like juli was trying to save mount rushmore or something they called her a strong voice in an urban wilderness and a radiant beacon shedding light on the need to curtail continued overdevelopment of our once quaint and tranquil community spare me i mean whats wrong with letting a guy cut down a tree on his own property so he can build a house his lot his tree his decision end of story the piece in the paper was gagme gush except except for the places where they quoted juli maybe it was just in contrast to the reporters slant or something but julis parts didnt come off ohwoeisme like i was expecting they were i dont know deep sitting in that tree was seriously philosophical to her and the odd thing is it all made sense to me she talked about what it felt like to be up in that tree and how it like transcended dimensional space to be held above the earth and brushed by the wind she said its like your heart has been kissed by beauty who in junior high do you know that would put together a sentence like that none of my friends thats for sure there was other stuff too like how something can be so much more than the parts it took to make it and why people need things around them that lift them above their lives and make them feel the miracle of living i wound up reading and rereading her parts wondering when in the world she started thinking like that i mean no kidding juli bakers smart but this was something way beyond straight as a month ago if id read this article i would have chucked it in the trash as complete garbage but for some reason it made sense to me now a lot of sense a month ago i also wouldnt have paid any attention to the picture of juli but now i found myself staring at it not the one of the whole scene that was more emergency rescue equipment than juli the other one on the bottom half of the page someone mustve used a killer telephoto lens because you can tell that shes in the tree but its mostly from the shoulders up shes looking off into the distance and the wind is blowing her hair back like shes at the helm of a ship or something sailing into the sun id spent so many years avoiding juli baker that id never really looked at her and now all of a sudden i couldnt stop this weird feeling started taking over the pit of my stomach and i didnt like it not one bit to tell you the truth it scared the sheetrock out of me i buried the paper under my pillow and tried to remind myself of what a pain juli baker was but my mind started to wander again and pretty soon i had that stupid paper out from under my pillow this was insane what was i doing i made myself shut out the light and go to bed i was slipping man and it was definitely time to get a grip the yard id never been embarrassed by where we lived before id never looked at our house or even our side of the street and said oh i wish we lived in the new developmentthose houses are so much newer so much better this is where id grown up this was my home i was aware of the yard sure my mother had grumbled about it for years but it was a low grumbling not worthy of deep concern or so id supposed but maybe i should have wondered why let the outside go and keep the
Document 28
inside so nice it was spotless inside our house except for the boys room that is mom gave up on that after she discovered the snake if they were old enough to adopt a snake she told my brothers they were old enough to clean their own room matt and mike translated this to keep the door closed and became quite diligent about doing just that besides the yard i also never really wondered about the money or the apparent lack thereof i knew we werent rich but i didnt feel like i was missing anything anything you could buy anyway matt and mike did ask for things a lot but even though my mother would tell them no boys we just cant afford that i took this to mean no boys you dont deserve that or no boys you dont really need that it wasnt until bryce called our home a complete dive that i started really seeing things it wasnt just the yard it was my dads truck my mothers car the family bike that was more rust than steel and the fact that when we did buy something new it always seemed to come from a secondtimearound store plus we never went on vacation ever why was that my father was the hardestworking man in the world and my mother worked for tempservice doing secretarial jobs whenever she could what was all that hard work about if this is where it got you asking my parents whether we were poor seemed incredibly impolite but as the days went by i knew i had to ask just had to every day id ride home from school on our rusty bike pull past the broken fence and patchy yard and think tonight ill ask them tonight but then i wouldnt ask them i just didnt know how then one day i had an idea a way to talk to them about it and maybe help out a little too and since my brothers were working at the music store that night and nobody was saying much of anything at the table i took a deep breath and said i was thinking you know that it wouldnt be hard to fix up the front yard if i could get some nails and a hammer and maybe some paint and how much does grass seed cost it cant be that much right i could plant a lawn and maybe even some flowers my parents stopped eating and stared at me i know how to use a saw and a hammerit could be you know a project my mother quit looking at me and stared at my father instead my father sighed and said the yard is not our responsibility julianna its its not he shook his head and said its mr finnegans whos mr finnegan the man who owns this house i couldnt believe my ears what my father cleared his throat and said the landlord you mean we dont own this house they looked at each other having some private wordless conversation i couldnt decipher finally my father said i didnt realize you didnt know that but but that doesnt make sense arent landlords supposed to come and do things like fix the roof when it leaks and clear the drains when theyre plugged you always do that stuff dad why do you do it when hes supposed to because he sighed its easier than asking him for help but if and my father interrupted me it keeps him from raising the rent but my mother reached over and took my hand sweetheart im sorry if this is a shock i guess we always thought you knew but what about the yard why keep up the inside but not the outside my father frowned and said when we signed the lease he assured us he would fix the fences front and back and plant sod in the front yard obviously that never happened he shook his head its a major undertaking and fencing is not cheap i cant see putting that sort of investment into a property thats not ours plus its the principle of the thing but we live here i whispered and it looks so bad my father studied me julianna what happened nothing daddy i said but he knew i was lying sweetheart he whispered tell me i knew what hed say if i told him and yet i couldnt not tell him not with the way he was looking at me so i took a deep breath and said the loskis have been throwing my eggs away because they were afraid theyd have salmonella because our yard is such a mess my father said oh thats ridiculous but my mother gasped what then she cried did patsy say that i looked down no bryce did but it mustve been a family discussion a boy doesnt come up with that on his own my mother looked for all the world like a doe waiting to be shot through the heart she covered her face with her hands and said i cant go on like this robert things have got to change theyve just got to trina you know im doing the best i can im sorry about the yard im sorry about the situation this isnt the picture i had for my life either but sometimes you have to sacrifice for whats right my mother looked up from her hands and said this is not right for our family your daughter is suffering because we wont fix up our own yard its not our yard how can you say that robert wake up we have lived here for twelve years its not temporary anymore if we ever want to have a decent place with our own yard if were going to help the kids through college or do any of the other things weve promised each other were going to have to move him into government care
Document 29
my father let out a deep sigh and whispered weve discussed this so many times trina in the end you always agree that keeping him at greenhaven is the right thing to do i wanted to say wait what are you talking about who are you talking about but the conversation was flying so fast and furious that i couldnt seem to break in and it wasnt long before they were bickering so badly that it was almost like i wasnt there then in the back of my mind it clicked everything clicked it was my dads brother they were talking about my uncle david to me uncle david was only a name someone my parents had explained to me but not someone id ever actually met and even though i knew my dad visited him i never knew exactly when he never talked about it dad also thought we shouldnt talk about uncle david to others because david was retarded people jump to conclusions hed told me they assume that by association something must also be wrong with you trust me i know so we didnt talk about it not at home not with friends it was almost like there was no uncle david until now now he felt larger than life and i could tell from their argument that he was the reason we didnt have our own house he was the reason we didnt have nice cars or fancy things he was the reason there always seemed to be a cloud of weariness hanging over my parents why did i have to bring up the yard in the first place id never seen my parents fight like this ever i wanted to grab them and say stop it stop it you love each other you do but i just sat there with tears streaming down my face my mother stopped suddenly and whispered we should not be doing this in front of her im sorry julianna my dad said then reached over and held my forearm dont cry none of this is your fault well work it out i promise we will my mother tried to laugh through her tears saying we always have and we always will that night my parents came into my room and talked to me one at a time my father talked about his brother and how much he loved him and how hed promised his parents hed always take care of him my mother talked about how much she loved my father for his strength and kind heart about dreams and reality and the need to count your blessings and she made me cry all over again when she kissed me goodnight and whispered that of all her many blessings i was her best and brightest i felt sorry for my father i felt sorry for my mother but most of all i felt lucky for me that they were mine and in the morning as i rode my rusty bike out the driveway to school i promised myself that when i got home id tackle the yard rented or not this was our home and i was going to help make living here better as it turns out this was easier thought than done first it took me half an hour of rummaging through the garage to find a hammer and a box of nails a saw and some pruners then it took another half hour of standing around to figure out just where to start the actual yard was just clumps of weeds but what about the bordering shrubs should i dig them up or prune them way back were they shrubs or just overgrown weeds and what about the fence should i knock it down or rebuild it maybe i should take out the front end entirely and use the wood to fix up the sides the longer i looked around the more i felt like forgetting the whole thing why bother it wasnt our property mr finnegan should be the one making repairs but then i remembered my mothers words from the night before surely i thought a few bushes and some dilapidated wood couldnt stop someones best and brightest blessing surely not and with that i picked up the clippers and got to work half an hour later i was keeper of the knowledge that one bush equals many branches and that the volume of a bush increases exponentially as its cut and tossed into the middle of a yard it was ridiculous where was i going to put all this stuff mom came home and tried to talk me out of my mission but id have none of it oh nonono id already pruned two bushes down to a respectable size and before long shed see the place was going to look just dandy you didnt get that stubborn streak from me she said but came back outside with a glass of juice and a kiss for my cheek good enough for meby the end of that first day what id made was a big mess but if chaos is a necessary step in the organization of ones universe then i was well on my way at least thats what i tried to tell myself when i flopped into bed that night dead tired and the next afternoon i was busily expanding the chaos of my little universe when i heard a deep voice say thats quite an undertaking young lady the man standing on our sidewalk was bryces grandfather i knew that much but id only ever seen him outside one time all the other times id seen him had been through windows either one in their sitting room or one in their car to me he was just a darkhaired man behind glass having him appear on my sidewalk was like having someone from tv step through the screen and talk to you i know weve seen each other from time to time

he was saying im sorry its taken me over a year to come introduce myself im chester duncan bryces grandfather and you of course are julianna baker he stuck out his hand so i took off my work glove and watched my hand completely disappear inside his as we shook nice to meet you mr duncan i said thinking that this man was way bigger than he looked from the sittingroom window then the strangest thing happened he pulled his own work gloves and a pair of clippers from a back pocket and said are you pruning all of these to the same height oh i said well yes that is what i was thinking although now i dont know do you think it would look better to just take them out he shook his head and said theyre australian tea shrubs theyll prune up nicely and with that he put on his gloves and started clipping at first i didnt know what to say to this man it was very strange to be getting his help but from the way he was acting it was as though i shouldnt have thought a thing of it clipclipclip he went like this was something he really enjoyed doing then i remembered what bryce had said about our yard and suddenly i knew why he was there whats the matter he asked throwing his clippings into my pile did i cut it down too far nno then why the look he asked i dont mean to make you uncomfortable i just thought you might like a little help well i dont i can do this by myself he laughed and said oh i have no doubt about that then got back to clipping you see julianna i read about you in the paper and ive lived across the street from you for over a year now its easy to see that youre a very competent person we both worked quietly for a minute but i found myself throwing the clippings into the pile harder and harder and before long i couldnt stand it i just couldnt stand it i spun on him and said youre here because you feel bad about the eggs arent you well our eggs are perfectly fine weve been eating them for nearly three years and none of us have gotten poisoned mrs stueby and mrs helms seem in good health to me too and the fact of the matter is if you didnt want them you shouldve just told me so his hands fell to his sides and he shook his head as he said eggs poisoned julianna i have no idea what youre talking about inside i was so angry and hurt and embarrassed that i didnt even feel like me im talking about the eggs that ive been bringing over to your house for more than two years eggs that my chickens laid that i couldve sold eggs that your family has been throwing away i was shouting at him shouting at an adult like id never shouted at anyone in my entire life his voice got very quiet im sorry i dont know about any eggs who did you give them to bryce my throat choked closed as i said his name again bryce mr duncan nodded slowly and said well then went back to pruning his bush that probably explains it what do you mean he sighed the boy still has a ways to go i just stared at him not trusting myself with the words sizzling on my tongue oh hes a very handsome boy theres no denying that he said with a frown then he snapped a branch and added the spitting image of his father i shook my head why are you over here mr duncan if you dont think i need the help and youre not feeling bad about the eggs then why would you do this honestly i just looked at him straight in the eye he nodded then said because you remind me of my wife your wife thats right he gave me a little smile and said rene wouldve sat up in that tree with you she wouldve sat there all night and with those two sentences my anger vanished really absolutely shes she died he nodded and i miss her terribly he tossed a branch into the heap and chuckled theres nothing like a headstrong woman to make you happy to be alive the last thing in the world i expected was to become friends with bryces grandfather but by dinnertime i knew so much about him and his wife and the adventures theyd had together that it seemed like id known him for a very long time plus all his stories made the work seem easy when i went in for the night the bushes were all pruned back and except for the enormous heap in the center of the yard things were already looking a whole lot better the next day he was back and when i smiled and said hi mr duncan he smiled back and said call me chet wont you he looked at the hammer in my hand and said i take it were starting on the fence today chet taught me how to plumb a line for the pickets how to hold a hammer down on the end of the handle instead of choking up on it how to calculate an adjusted spacing for the pickets and how to use a level to get the wood exactly vertical we worked on the fence for days and the whole time we worked we talked it wasnt just about his wife either he wanted to know about the sycamore tree and seemed to understand exactly what i meant when i told about the whole being greater than the sum of its parts its that way with people too he said only with people its sometimes that the whole is less than
Document 31
the sum of the parts i thought that was pretty interesting and the next day during school i looked around at the people id known since elementary school trying to figure out if they were more or less than the sum of their parts chet was right a lot of them were less top of the list of course was shelly stalls to look at her youd think she had everything but theres not much solid underneath her mount everest hair and even though shes like a black hole at sucking people in it doesnt take them long to figure out that being friends with her requires fanning the flames of a wildfire ego but of all my classmates the one person i couldnt seem to place was bryce until recently id have said with absolute certainty that he was greaterfar greaterthan the sum of his parts what he did to my heart was sheer inexplicable magic but inexplicable was the operative word here and as i looked across the room at him during math i couldnt help feeling crushed all over again about how hed thrown out my eggs what kind of person would do that then he looked my way and smiled and my heart lurched but i was mad at myself for it how could i still feel this way after what hed done i avoided him the rest of the day but by the end of school there was a tornado inside me tearing me up from one end to the other i jumped on my bike and rode home faster than i ever had before the right pedal clanked against the chain guard and the whole bike rattled and squeaked threatening to collapse into a pile of rusty parts the tornado however was still going strong when i skidded to a halt in our driveway so i transferred pedal power into painting power i pried open the gallon of navajo white my dad had bought me and started slopping paint around chet appeared about ten minutes later my he laughed youve got an enviable amount of energy today dont you no i said brushing back some hair with the back of my hand im just mad he produced his own brush and an empty coffee can uhoh who at myself oh thats a tough one did you do poorly on a test no i i turned to him and said how did you fall in love with your wife he poured some navajo white into his can and smiled ah he said boy problems i do not have boy problems he hesitated but didnt argue instead he said i fell in love with her by mistake by mistake what do you mean i didnt intend to at the time i was engaged to somebody else and in no position to fall in love fortunately for me i saw how blind id been before it was too late blind yes my fiance was very beautiful she had the most magnificent brown eyes and skin like an angel and for a time all i could see was her beauty but then well lets just say i discovered she wasnt a fraction of the person rene was he dipped his brush in the coffee can and stroked a picket with paint its easy to look back and see it and its easy to give the advice but the sad fact is most people dont look beneath the surface until its too late we were quiet a minute but i could see chet thinking and from the furrow in his brow i knew it had nothing to do with my problems im im sorry i brought up your wife i said oh dont be thats all right he shook his head and tried on a smile besides i wasnt thinking of rene i was thinking of someone else someone whos never been able to look beneath the surface at this point i dont suppose i even want her to who was he talking about i wanted to know but i felt it would be crossing some line to ask so we painted pickets in silence at last he turned to me and said get beyond his eyes and his smile and the sheen of his hairlook at whats really there the way he said it sent a chill through me it was as though he knew and suddenly i felt defensive was he telling me his grandson wasnt worth it when it was time to go in for dinner i still didnt feel right but at least the tornado was gone mom said dad was working late and since the boys were off with their friends it was just the two of us she told me that she and dad had talked about it and that they both felt a little strange having chet come over like he was maybe she said they should find a way to pay him for his help i told her i thought chet would find that insulting but the next day she went ahead and insulted him anyway chet said no mrs baker its been my pleasure to help out your daughter on this project and wouldnt hear another word about it the week ended with my dad loading the back of his truck with all the clippings and scraps before he set off for work on saturday morning then chet and i spent the rest of the day hoeing up weeds and raking and readying the dirt for seeding it was on this last day that chet asked your familys not moving are you moving why do you say that oh my daughter brought up the possibility at the dinner table last night she thought that maybe youre fixing up the house because youre getting ready to sell it even though chet and i had talked about a lot of things while we were working i probably wouldnt have told him about

mr finnegan or uncle david or why the yard was such a mess if he hadnt asked me about moving but since he had well i wound up telling him everything and it felt good to talk about it especially about uncle david it felt like blowing a dandelion into the wind and watching all the little seeds float off up and away i was proud of my parents and looking around the front yard i was proud of me too just wait until i got my hands on the backyard then maybe id even paint the house i could do it i could chet was pretty quiet after i told him the story and when mom brought us out sandwiches at lunchtime we sat on the porch and ate without saying a word then he broke the silence by nodding across the street and saying i dont know why he doesnt just come out and say hello who i asked then looked across the street to where hed nodded the curtain in bryces room moved quickly back into place and i couldnt help asking bryce thats the third time ive seen him watching really my heart was fluttering about like a baby bird trying to fly he frowned and said lets finish up and get that seed sown shall we youll want the warmth of the day to help with the germination i was happy to finally be planting the yard but i couldnt help being distracted by bryces window was he watching during the rest of the afternoon i checked more often than id like to admit and im afraid chet noticed too because when we were all done and wed congratulated each other on what was sure to be a finelooking yard he said he may be acting like a coward now but i do hold out hope for the boy a coward what on earth could i say to that i just stood there with the hose in one hand and the spigot valve beneath the other and with that chet waved so long and walked across the street a few minutes later i saw bryce coming down the sidewalk toward his house i did a double take all this time id thought he was inside the house watching and he was really outside walking around i was embarrassed all over again i turned my back on him and concentrated on watering the yard what a fool i was what a complete idiot and i had just built up a nice head of angry steam when i heard its looking good juli nice job it was bryce standing right there on our driveway and suddenly i wasnt mad at me anymore i was mad at him how could he stand there like my supervisor and tell me nice job he had no business saying anything after what hed done i was about to hose him down when he said im sorry for what i did juli it was you know wrong i looked at himinto those brilliant blue eyes and i tried to do what chet had saidi tried to look past them what was behind them what was he thinking was he really sorry or was he just feeling bad about the things hed said it was like looking into the sun though and i had to turn away i couldnt tell you what we talked about after that except that he was nice to me and he made me laugh and after he left i shut off the water and went inside feeling very very strange the rest of the evening i bounced back and forth between upset and uneasy the worst part being i couldnt really put my finger on what exactly i was upset or uneasy about of course it was bryce but why wasnt i just mad hed been such a scoundrel or happy why wasnt i just happy hed come over to our house hed stood on our driveway hed said nice things wed laughed but i wasnt mad or happy and as i lay in bed trying to read i realized that upset had been overshadowed by uneasy i felt as though someone was watching me i got so spooked i even got up and checked out the window and in the closet and under the bed but still the feeling didnt go away it took me until nearly midnight to understand what it was it was me watching me looming large and smelly sunday i woke up feeling like id been sick with the flu like id had one of those bad convoluted unexplainable fever dreams and what ive figured out about bad convoluted unexplainable dreams of any kind is that youve just got to shake them off try to forget that they ever happened i shook it off all right and got out of bed early cause i had eaten almost nothing the night before and i was starving but as i was trucking into the kitchen i glanced into the family room and noticed that my dad was sacked out on the couch this was not good this was a sign of battles still in progress and it made me feel like an invader in my own territory he rolled over and kind of groaned then curled up tighter under his skinny little quilt and muttered some pretty unfriendlysounding stuff into his pillow i beat it into the kitchen and poured myself a killer bowl of corn flakes and i was about to drown it in milk when my mother comes waltzing in and snags it away from me you are going to wait young man she says this family is going to have sunday breakfast together but im starving so are the rest of us now go im making pancakes and youre taking a shower go like a showers going to prevent imminent starvation but i headed down to the bathroom and on my way
Document 33
i noticed that the family room was empty the quilt was folded and back on the armrest the pillow was goneit was like id imagined the whole thing at breakfast my father didnt look like hed spent the night on the couch no bags under his eyes no whiskers on his chin he was decked out in tennis shorts and a lavender polo shirt and his hair was all blown dry like it was a workday personally i thought the shirt looked kind of girly but my mom said you look very nice this morning rick my father just eyed her suspiciously then my grandfather came in saying patsy the house smells wonderful good morning rick hi there bryce and winked at me as he sat down and put his napkin in his lap lynetta my mother sang out breakfast my sister appeared in a triplex miniskirt and platform shoes with eyes that were definitely of the raccoon variety my mother gasped but then took a deep breath and said good morning honey youre youre i thought you were going to church this morning with your friends i am lynetta scowled and sat down mom brought pancakes fried eggs and hash browns to the table my father just sat there stiff as a board for a minute but finally he shook out his napkin and tucked it into his collar well my mother said as she sat down i have come up with a solution to our situation here it comes my father muttered but my mother gave him a glare that shut him down cold the solution is my mom said as she served herself some pancakes were going to invite the bakers over for dinner my father blurts out what lynetta asks all of them i put in are you serious but my grandfather heaps on another fried egg and says that patsy is a marvelous idea thanks dad she says with a smile then tells lynetta and me of course im serious and yes if juli and the boys want to come theyll be invited my sister starts cracking up do you know what youre saying mom smooths the napkin into her lap maybe its about time i found out lynetta turns to me and says shes inviting the core of piss poor over for dinner oh this is something i really woke up expecting my father shakes his head and says patsy what purpose does this serve so i made some stupid cracks last night is this the next phase in my punishment it is something we should have done years ago patsy please i know you feel bad about what you found out but an awkward dinner party isnt going to change anything my mother ran syrup all over her pancakes popped the top closed licked her finger then locked eyes with my dad we are having the bakers over for dinner and that she didnt have to tell him was that dad took a deep breath then sighed and said whatever you want patsy just dont say i didnt warn you he took a bite of hash browns and mumbled a barbecue i suppose no rick a sitdown dinner like we have when your clients come over he stopped chewing youre expecting them to dress up mom glared at him what im expecting is for you to behave like the gentleman i always thought you were dad went back to his potatoes definitely safer than arguing with mom lynetta wound up eating the entire white of a fried egg and almost a whole pancake besides plain of course but from the way she was glutting and giggling as she ate it was obvious that at least she was in a good mood granddad ate plenty even for him but i couldnt tell what he was thinking he was back to looking more granite than human me id started tuning in to the fact that this dinner could be more than awkward it could be trouble those rotten eggs were back from the grave looming large and smelly right over my head sure granddad knew but no one else in my family did what if it came up at dinner id be dead fried cluckfaced meat later as i was brushing my teeth i considered bribing juli getting her on board so that nobody brought up the subject of eggs or maybe i could sabotage the dinner somehow make it not happen yeah i could i stopped myself and looked in the mirror what kind of wimp was i anyway i spit and headed back to find my mom what is it honey she asked me as she wiped off the griddle you look worried i doublechecked to make sure my dad or lynetta wasnt lurking around somewhere then whispered will you swear to secrecy she laughed i dont know about that i just waited what can be she said then looked at me and stopped cleaning oh it is serious honey whats wrong it had been ages since id voluntarily fessed up about something to my mom it just didnt seem necessary anymore id learned to deal with things on my own at least thats what id thought until now she touched my arm and said bryce tell me what is it i hopped up to sit on the counter then took a deep breath and said its about julis eggs about her eggs yeah remember that whole chickenhensalmonella disaster that was quite a while ago but sure well what you dont know is that juli didnt bring eggs over just that once shes been bringing them over every weekor about that anyway she has why didnt i know about this well i was afraid dad would get mad at me for not telling her we didnt want them so i started intercepting them id see her coming get to her before she rang the bell and then id toss them in the trash
Document 34
before anyone knew shed been here oh bryce well i kept thinking theyd stop how long can a stupid chicken lay eggs but i take it they have stopped yeah as of last week because juli caught me chucking a carton in the trash outside oh dear exactly so what did you tell her i looked down and mumbled i told her that we were afraid of salmonella poisoning because their yard was such a mess she ran off crying and the next thing i know shes starting to fix up their yard oh bryce exactly she was dead quiet for a minute then very softly she said thank you for your honesty bryce it does help to explain a lot she shook her head and said what that family must think of us and got back to cleaning the griddle all the more reason to have them over for dinner if you ask me i whispered youre sworn to secrecy on this whole egg thing right i mean juli told granddad so he knows but i dont want this to spread to you know dad she studied me a minute then said tell me youve learned your lesson honey i have mom okay then i let out a big sigh of relief thanks oh and bryce yeah im very glad you told me about it she kissed me on the cheek then smiled and said now didnt i hear you promise youd mow the lawn today right i said and headed outside to trim the turf that evening my mother announced that the bakers would be over friday night at six oclock that the menu included poached salmon crab risotto and fresh steamed vegetables and that none of us had better weasel out of being there my dad muttered that if we were really going to do this it would be a whole lot better to barbecue because at least that way hed have something to do but my mom positively smoked him with her eyes and he dropped it so they were coming and it made seeing juli at school even more uncomfortable than usual not because she gushed about it or even waved and winked or something no she was back to avoiding me shed say hi if we happened to run into each other but instead of being like right over my shoulder anytime i looked she was nowhere she must have ducked out back doors and taken roundabout ways through campus she was i dont know scarce i found myself looking at her in class the teacherd be talking and all eyes would be up front except mine they kept wandering over to juli it was weird one minute id be listening to the teacher and the next id be completely tuned out looking at juli it wasnt until wednesday in math that i figured it out with the way her hair fell back over her shoulders and her head was tilted she looked like the picture in the paper not just like it the angle was different and the wind wasnt blowing through her hair but she did look like the picture a lot like the picture making that connection sent a chill down my spine and i wondered what was she thinking could she really be that interested in root derivations darla tressler caught me watching and man she gave me the worlds wickedest smile if i didnt do something fast this was going to spread like wildfire so i squinted at her and whispered theres a bee in her hair stupid then pointed around in the air like there it goes see darlas neck whipped around searching for the bee and i straightened out my focus for the rest of the day the last thing i needed was to be scorched by the likes of darla tressler that night i was doing my homework and just to prove to myself that id been wrong i pulled that newspaper article out of my trash can and as im flipping it over im telling myself its a distortion of reality its my imagination she doesnt really look like that but there she was the girl in my math class two rows over and one seat up glowing through newsprint lynetta barged in i need your sharpener she said i slammed my binder closed over the paper and said youre supposed to knock and then since she was zooming in and the paper was still sticking out i crammed the binder into my backpack as fast as i could what are you trying to hide there baby brother nothing and stop calling me that and dont barge into my room anymore give me your sharpener and im history she said with her hand out i dug it out of my drawer and tossed it at her and sure enough she disappeared but two seconds later my mom was calling for me and after that well i forgot that the paper was in my binder until first period the next morning that is man what was i supposed to do with it i couldnt get up and throw it out garrett was right there besides that darla tresslers in that class and i could tell she was keeping an eye out for wayward bees if she caught wind of this id be the one stung then garrett reaches over to snag a piece of paper like he does about fourteen times a day only i have a complete mental spaz and slam down on his hand with mine dude he says whats your problem sorry i say tuning in to the fact that he was only going for lined paper not newspaper dude he says again you know youve been really spaced lately anyone else tell you that he rips a piece of paper out of my binder then notices the edges of the newspaper he eyes me and before i can stop him he whips

it out i pounce on him and tear it out of his hands but its too late hes seen her picture before he can say a word i get in his face and say you shut up you hear me this is not what you think whoa kick back will ya i wasnt thinking anything but i could see the little gears go clickclickclick in his brain then he smirks at me and says im sure youve got a perfectly reasonable explanation for why youre carrying a picture of juli baker around with you the way he said it scared me like he was playing with the idea of roasting me in front of the whole class i leaned over and said zip it would you the teacher hammered on us to be quiet but it didnt stop garrett from smirking at me or doing the doubleeyebrow wiggle in the direction of my binder after class darla tried to act all cool and preoccupied but she had her radar up and pointed our way she shadowed me practically all day so there was no real window of opportunity to explain things to garrett what was i going to tell him anyway that the paper was in my binder because i was trying to hide it from my sister that would help besides i didnt want to make up some lame lie about it i actually wanted to talk to garrett i mean he was my friend and a lot had happened in the last couple of months that was weighing on me i thought that if i talked to him maybe hed help get me back on track help me to stop thinking about everything garrett was real reliable in that arena luckily in social studies our class got library time to do research for our famous historical figure report darla and juli were both in that class but i managed to drag garrett into a back corner of the library without either of them noticing and the minute we were by ourselves i found myself laying into garrett about chickens he shakes his head at me and says dude what are you talking about remember when we went and looked over her fence back in the sixth grade yeah remember how you were down on me for wondering what a hen was he rolled his eyes not this again man you didnt know jackdiddlysquat about chickens i put my life in your hands and you dumped me in a bucket of bull so i told him about my dad and the eggs and salmonella and how id been intercepting eggs for nearly two years he just shrugged and said makes sense to me man she caught me who juli whoa dude i told him about what id said and how almost right after that she was out playing weed warrior in her front yard well so its not your fault her yards a mess but then i found out that they dont even own that house theyre all poor because her dads got a retarded brother that theyre you know paying for garrett gives me a real chumpy grin and says a retard well that explains a lot doesnt it i couldnt believe my ears what you know he says still grinning about juli my heart started pounding and my hands clenched up and for the first time since id learned to dive away from trouble i wanted to deck somebody but we were in the library and besides it flashed through my mind that if i decked him for what hed said hed turn around and tell everyone that i was hot for juli baker and i was not hot for juli baker so i made myself laugh and say oh right and then came up with an excuse to put some distance between him and me after school garrett asked me to come to his house and hang for a while but i had zero interest in that i still wanted to slug him i tried to talk myself down from feeling that way but in my gut i was flaming mad at the guy hed crossed the line man hed crossed it bigtime and what made the whole thing so stinking hard to ignore was the fact that standing right next to him on the other side of the line was my father the visit sunday mornings are peaceful in our house my father lets himself sleep in my mother lets herself not fix breakfast and if my brothers have been out late playing with their band you wont even know theyre around until noon usually i tiptoe out to collect eggs while everyone else is asleep then spirit a bowl of cheerios back to my room to have breakfast in bed and read but that sundayafter spending most of the night feeling upset or uneasyi woke up wanting to do something physical to shake off the confused way i was still feeling what i really needed was a good climb in my sycamore tree but i settled for watering the lawn while i tried to think of other things i cranked open the spigot and admired how rich and black the dirt looked as i sprinkled back and forth across the soil and i was busy talking to my buried seedlings coaxing them to spring up and greet the rising sun when my father came outside his hair was damp from a shower and he had a grocery sack rolled closed in his hand dad im sorry if i woke you you didnt sweetheart ive been up for a while youre not going to work are you no i he studied me for a moment then said im going to visit david uncle david he walked toward his truck saying thats right i i should be back around noon but dad why today its sunday i know sweetheart but its a special sunday i turned

off the spigot whys that its his fortieth birthday i want to see him and deliver a gift he said as he held up the paper bag dont worry ill rustle us up some pancakes for lunch all right im coming with you i said and tossed the hose aside i wasnt even really dressedid just pulled on some sweats and sneakers no socks but in my mind there was no doubt i was going why dont you stay home and enjoy the morning with your mother im sure she would i went over to the passenger side of his truck and said im coming then climbed inside and slammed the door back in place but he said through the drivers door im coming dad he studied me a moment then said okay and put the bag on the bench seat let me leave a note for your mother while he was inside i strapped on the lap belt and told myself that this was good this was something i shouldve done years ago uncle david was part of the family part of my father part of me it was about time i got to know him i studied the paper sack sitting next to me what was my father bringing his brother for his fortieth birthday i picked it up it wasnt a paintingit was much too light for that plus it made a strange muted rattling noise when i shook it i was just unrolling the top to peek inside when my father came back through the front door i dropped the sack and straightened up and when he slid behind the wheel i said its okay with you isnt it he just looked at me his hand on the key in the ignition i im not ruining your day with him or anything am i he cranked the motor and said no sweetheart im glad youre coming we didnt say much to each other on the drive over to greenhaven he seemed to want to look at the scenery and i well i had a lot of questions but none i wanted to ask it was nice though riding with my father it was like the silence connected us in a way that explanations never could when we arrived at greenhaven my father parked the truck but we didnt get out right away it takes some getting used to julianna but it does grow on you they grow on you theyre all good people i nodded but felt oddly afraid come on then he said taking the sack from the seat lets go inside greenhaven didnt look like any kind of hospital to me but it didnt look quite like a house either it was too long and rectangular for that the walkway had a faded green awning that covered it and flower beds alongside with freshly planted pansies that looked muddied and slightly askew the grass was patchy with three deep holes dug near the building the residents tend the grounds my father said its part of their occupational training program and its therapeutic those holes are the future homes of peach plum and pear fruit trees yes the vote caused quite a commotion among the residents thats right he swung open one of the glass double doors and said come on in it was cool inside and it smelled of pine cleaner and bleach with something vaguely pungent underneath there wasnt a reception desk or waiting area just a large intersection with white walls and narrow wooden benches to the left was a big room with a television and several rows of plastic chairs to the right were open office doors and beside us were two pine armoires one was open with half a dozen gray sweaters hung neatly in a row good morning robert a woman called through one of the office doors good morning josie my father replied she came out to meet us saying davids up and about has been since around six mabel tells me its his birthday today mabel is right again he turned to me and smiled josie its my pleasure to introduce my daughter julianna julianna meet josie gruenmakker well now isnt this nice josie said clasping my hand i recognize you from davids photo album youre gettin ready to graduate into high school isnt that right i blinked at her then looked at my dad id never really thought of it that way but i could see that he had yes i i suppose i am josies the site administrator and josie added with a laugh im not graduatin to nowhere been here seventeen years and im staying put the phone rang and she hurried off saying gotta get that ill meet up with you in a bit check the rec room then his room youll find him my dad led me around a corner and as we proceeded down a hallway the underlying pungent part of the smell got stronger like the place had had years of mystery pissers with no one quite neutralizing what had been tagged down the hall was a small person hunched in a wheelchair at first i thought it was a child but as we approached i could see it was a woman she had almost no hair and as she gave my dad a toothless smile she grabbed his hand and spoke my heart bottomed out the sounds she made were choked and lost on her tongue nothing she said was intelligible yet she looked at my father with such intensitylike of course he understood what she was saying to my complete surprise he said youre absolutely right mabel it is today which is why im here he held up the grocery sack and whispered ive brought him a little gift gwaaaal she said howd you know she gurgled at him until he patted her hand and said im much too predictable im afraid but he enjoys them and he

passion for strawberry milkshakes i managed a smile and whispered nice to meet you but all i got in return was a suspicious scowl well were off to davids my father said then shook the bag dont spill the beans if he happens by i followed him to a bedroom doorway where he stopped and called david david its robert a man appeared at the door a man i would never have picked out as my fathers brother he was stocky with thick brown glasses and his face looked puffy and pale but he threw his arms around my fathers chest and cried wobbad yaw heew yes i am little brother i followed them into the room and saw that the walls were covered in a collage of puzzles theyd been glued directly to the walls and even up on the ceiling it was cozy and comfortable and interesting i felt as though id entered a quilted cave my father held his brother at arms length and said and look who ive brought along for a split second david looked almost frightened but then my father said its my daughter julianna davids face broke into a smile juweeeanna he cried then practically tackled me with a hug i thought i was going to suffocate my face was buried as he squeezed the air out of me and rocked from side to side then with a giggle he let go and flopped into a chair is mooy bwufday i know uncle david happy birthday he giggled again fwank eoow we brought you a present my dad said as he opened the paper sack before he had it out before i saw the actual size i remembered the sound it had made when id shaken it in the truck of course i thought a puzzle uncle david guessed it too a puwwwle not just a puzzle my dad said as he pulled it out of the sack a puzzle and a pinwheel dad had wrapped the puzzle box up in pretty blue paper and had taped the redandyellow pinwheel on as a bow uncle david snatched the pinwheel right off and blew first gently then fiercely in great spitty bursts ownge he cried between blows ownge very gently dad took it from him and smiled red and yellow do make orange dont they david tried to grab it back but my father said well take it outside later the wind will blow it for you and pressed the puzzle back in his hands as the wrapping paper fell in shreds on the floor i leaned in to see what sort of puzzle my father had bought him and gasped three thousand pieces and the image was simply white clouds and blue sky no shading no treesnothing but the clouds and the sky my father pointed to a spot in the center of the ceiling i thought it would fit just right over there uncle david looked up and nodded then lunged for his pinwheel and said owsiiide sure lets go out for a walk feel like going down to mcelliots for a birthday ice cream uncle davids head bobbed up and down yaaah we checked out through josie then headed down the street david cant walk very fast because his body seems to want to move inward instead of forward his feet pigeontoe and his shoulders hunch in and he seemed to lean on my father pretty heavily as we moved along but he kept that pinwheel in front of him watching it spin crying every now and then owwwange owwwange mcelliots turned out to be a drugstore with an ice cream parlor inside there was a redand whitestriped awning over the ice cream counter and there were little white tables and chairs set in an area with redandwhitestriped wallpaper it was very festivelooking especially for being inside a drugstore dad got us all cones and once we were sitting down dad and david did talk to each other some but mostly david wanted to eat his chocolate fudge swirl my father smiled at me from time to time and i smiled back but i felt disconnected how many times had the two of them come here for ice cream how many birthdays had my father celebrated with his brother like this how long had he known mabel and josie and the rest of the people at greenhaven how could it be that in all these years id never spent any time with my uncle it was like my father had a secret life away from me a complete family away from me i didnt like it didnt understand it and i was getting myself pretty worked up about it when davids cone crushed in his grip causing his ice cream to flop onto the table before my dad could stop him david picked up the ice cream and tried to cram it back onto the cone but the cone was shattered and the ice cream fell over again only this time it landed on the floor my dad said leave it david ill get you a new one but david didnt listen his chair shot back and he dove after it no david let me get you a new one my dad pulled him by the arm but david wouldnt budge he grabbed the ice cream and crammed it back onto what was left of his cone and when the bottom part of his cone crumbled completely away he started screaming it was awful he was like a twohundredpound infant throwing a tantrum on the floor he was yelling words i couldnt understand and after a minute of trying to calm him down my father said julianna can you get him another cone the man

behind the counter scooped as fast as he could but in that short time david knocked over a table and two chairs with his flailing and managed to smear chocolate everywhere the checkers and customers at the registers seemed frozen with terrorlike david was some sort of monster out to destroy the world i gave the new cone to my father who handed it to david right there on the floor and while david sat there eating it my father and i worked around him putting everything back in order and wiping up the mess on the walk back to greenhaven david acted like nothing had happened he spurted into his pinwheel and cried owwwange from time to time but when my dad held open the front door i could tell that david was tired down in his room david placed the pinwheel on his bed and picked up the puzzle box why dont you take a rest before you get started on it my dad asked david shook his head naaow okay then let me help you set it up my father pulled a card table from beneath the bed then swung the legs out and snapped them into place after he had it shoved up against the wall near the bed he moved a chair close to it and said there you are all set up david had the box open and was already sifting through the pieces aaaas a gou wwwone wobbad im glad you like it you think you might have it done by wednesday i can come back and glue it on the ceiling for you then if youd like david nodded but he was already intent on the puzzle carefully laying pieces on the table my father put his hand on his shoulder and said ill see you wednesday then okay he nodded will you say goodbye to julianna baaawye he said but he didnt look up from his box of pieces see you later uncle david i tried to sound cheerful but i didnt feel that way when we got back into the truck my dad clicked on his seat belt and said so i just looked at him and tried to smile are you as exhausted as i am he said i nodded everything was fineexcept for the ice cream dad chuckled except for the ice cream then he turned serious the trouble is you never know what the ice cream is going to be sometimes its a fly in the room sometimes its the feel of his socks its hard to predict everything usually getting ice cream is safe he shook his head and closed his eyes thinking things i couldnt imagine finally he turned the ignition and said david lived with your mother and me for a while before you kids were born we thought it would be better for him to live with us than to be in a home but we were wrong but overall everything went okay today he ground the gearshift into reverse david has many many special needs both emotional and physical your mom and i couldnt handle them all fortunately hes happy here they have programs to teach him how to care for himself how to dress and bathe and brush his teeth how to act around others and communicate they go on outings and he has a job doing mailings for a doctors office he does he goes there every morning during the week to fold mailings and fill envelopes greenhavens been so good for him he gets an incredible amount of individualized attention he has his own room his own friends his own life after a minute i said but hes part of the family dad and it just doesnt seem right that hes never been over for a visit not even on christmas or thanksgiving he doesnt want to sweetheart one year your mother and i insisted he spend thanksgiving with us and it was the biggest disaster you can imagine he broke a window out of the car he was that upset but why havent we been visiting him i know you have but the rest of us why not well its draining your mother finds it incredibly depressing and i understand that we both agreed that it was no place to take small children he accelerated onto the highway silent behind the wheel finally he said the years just seem to slip away julianna one day you have a baby in your arms and the next you realize shes very nearly a woman he smiled at me sadly i love david but he is a burden and i guess i wanted to protect you from that but i realize now that all of this has affected you and the family but dad its not julianna what im trying to tell you is im sorry there was so much i wanted to give you all of you i guess i didnt see until recently how little ive actually provided thats not true well i think you know my hearts been in the right place but if you line it up objectively a man like say mr loski adds up to a much better husband and father than a man like me does hes around more he provides more and hes probably a lot more fun my dad wasnt one to go fishing for compliments or signs of appreciation but still i couldnt quite believe he actually thought that dad i dont care how it looks on paper i think youre the best dad ever and when i marry somebody someday i sure dont want him to be like mr loski i want him to be like you he looked at me like he couldnt quite believe his ears is that so he said with a grin well ill remind you of that as your someday approaches that turned the rest of the trip around we laughed and joked and talked
Document 39
about all kinds of things but as we neared home there was one thing the conversation kept turning back to pancakes my mother though had other plans shed spent the morning scrubbing floors and nixed the pancakes i need something with more staying power like grilled hamandcheese with onions she said lots of onions scrubbing floors my dad said its sunday trina why were you scrubbing floors nervous energy she looked at me howd it go okay im glad i went she glanced at my dad and then at me well good she sighed then said i also felt like scrubbing because i got a call from patsy loski my dad asked is something wrong my mother pushed a few wisps of hair back and said no she called to invite us over for dinner on friday we blinked at her a moment then i asked all of us yes i could see what my dad was thinking why all these years of living across the street and wed never been invited over why now my mom could see it too she sighed and said robert i dont exactly know why but she was insistent she was practically in tears saying how sorry she was that shed never invited us before and how shed really like to get to know us better what did you tell her i couldnt very well say no she was being so nice and chet has really done a lot she shrugged and said i said wed go its set for six oclock friday night really i asked she shrugged again i think it might be nice a little strange but nice well okay then my dad said i wont schedule any overtime for friday what about the boys theres no gig on the calendar and theyre not scheduled to work but i havent talked to them about it yet are you sure they want us all over there my dad asked my mom nodded she insists i could tell the whole idea of dinner at the loskis was making my dad pretty uncomfortable but we could both see that something about this invitation meant a lot to my mother all right then he said and got to work slicing cheese and onions for the rest of the afternoon i sort of lazed around reading and daydreaming and at school the next day i couldnt seem to concentrate my thoughts kept turning back to david i wondered what my grandparents had been like and what theyd gone through having a son like him i daydreamed a lot about the sycamore tree too which at first i thought was because i was feeling melancholy but then i remembered how my mother had called the sycamore a testimony to endurance it had survived being damaged as a sapling it had grown other people thought it was ugly but i never had maybe it was all how you looked at it maybe there were things i saw as ugly that other people thought were beautiful like shelly stalls a perfect example to me there was absolutely nothing to recommend her but the rest of the world seemed to think she was the cats meow meow anyway i sort of drifted through the week like that until thursday thursday our social studies class went to the library to do research for our famous historical figure report id chosen susan b anthony and her fight for the right to vote and i was in the middle of tracking down some books when darla tressler flagged me from the end of a stack darla was in a few of my classes but we werent really friends so i looked behind me to see who else she might be flagging come here she mouthed frantically waving me over so i hurried over she pointed through the column of books and whispered listen it was garretts voice and then bryces and they were talking about me about my chickens and salmonella poisoning and how bryce had been throwing away my eggs and about me fixing up our yard bryce was sounding like he felt really bad but then suddenly my blood ran cold he was talking about david and then garrett laughed and said a retard well that explains a lot doesnt it you know about juli for a second there was silence and at that moment i was sure they must be able to hear my heart pounding in my chest but then bryce laughed and said oh right i positively crumbled onto the floor and in a flash the voices were gone darla checked around the corner then sat beside me saying oh jules im so so sorry i thought he was about to confess that hes been crushing on you what darla bryce does not have a crush on me where have you been havent you noticed the way hes been looking at you that boy is lost in loveland oh obviously you just heard him darla yeah but yesterday yesterday i caught him staring at you and he said there was a bee in your hair a bee girl is that the lamest coverup youve ever heard or what darla the way things have been going i wouldnt be surprised if there was a bee in my hair oh you think youre that sweet huh just attract bees like honey well honey the only bee youre attracting around here is bryce cute yeah but after what i just heard id stomp and grind girl stomp and grind she got up to go but turned and said dont worry i wont jabber i just shook my head and forgot about darla how wrong could a person be it was what bryce and garrett had said that i couldnt forget how could they be so cruel and so stupid is this what my father had gone through growing up the more i thought about it the angrier i got what right
Document 40
did bryce have to make fun of my uncle how dare he i felt fire burn in my cheeks and a cold hard knot tighten in my heart and in a flash i knewi was through with bryce loski he could keep his brilliant blue eyes he could keep his twofaced smile and and my kiss thats right he could keep that too i was never ever going to talk to him again i stormed back to the section of books on susan b anthony found two that would work and then went back to my table but as i was collecting my things to check out of the library i remembered the next day we were going to the loskis house for dinner i zipped up my backpack and threw it on my shoulder surely after what had happened i had the right to vote against going didnt i the serious willies realizing that my father had the same sense of humor as garrett gave me the serious willies i had the hardest time just looking at my dad let alone speaking to him but at about five oclock friday afternoon i agreed with him about one thing we shouldve barbecued a barbecue is more you know lowkey instead my mom was flying around the kitchen slicing and dicing and barking orders at dad and me like the president was coming to dinner we swept the floor put an extra leaf in the table brought in five more chairs and set the table we set it all wrong of course but all my mother had to do was shuffle things around to make it right it looked the same to me but what do i know she put out candlesticks and said rick can you load the dishes and run them id like a chance to get cleaned up after that you can change and bryce what are you wearing mom its the bakers are you trying to make them feel totally worthless trina and i agreed on a dressup so but why my dad put a hand on my shoulder and said so we can all feel equally uncomfortable son women i looked at her and said does that mean i have to wear a tie no but some sort of buttondown instead of a tshirt would be nice i went down to my room and ripped through my closet looking for something with buttons there were lots of buttons all right lots of geeky buttons i thought about boycotting my mothers dresscode requirements but instead i started putting on shirts twenty minutes later i still wasnt dressed and i was extremely ticked off about it because what did it matter why did i care what i looked like at this stupid dinner i was acting like a girl then through a gap in my curtains i saw them coming out their front door down their walkway across the street it was like a weird dream they seemed to be floating toward our house all five of them i pulled a shirt off my bed punched my arms in and buttoned up two seconds later the doorbell rang and mom called can you get that bryce luckily granddad beat me to it he greeted them all like they were longlost family and even seemed to know which one was matt and which one was mike one was wearing a purple shirt and the other was wearing a green one so it shouldnt have been that hard to remember which was which but they came in and pinched my cheeks and said hey baby brother hows it goin and i got so mad i mixed them up again my mother zoomed in from the kitchen saying come in come in its so nice you all could make it she called lynetta rick weve got compa ny but then stopped short when she saw juli and mrs baker well whats this she asked homemade pies mrs baker said blackberry cheesecake and pecan they look wonderful absolutely wonderful my mother was acting so hyper i couldnt believe it she took julis pie then whooshed a path to the kitchen with mrs baker lynetta appeared from around the corner which made matt and mike grin and say hey lyn lookin good black skirt black nails black eyes for a nocturnal rodent yeah i suppose she was looking good they disappeared down to lynettas room and when i turned around my granddad was taking mr baker into the front room which left me in the entry hall with juli alone she wasnt looking at me she seemed to be looking at everything but me and i felt like an idiot standing there in my geeky buttondown shirt with pinched cheeks and nothing to say and i got so nervous about having nothing to say that my heart started going wacko on me hammering like it does right before a race or a game or something on top of that she looked more like that stupid picture in the paper than the picture did if that makes any sense not because she was all dressed up she wasnt she was wearing some normallooking dress and normallooking shoes and her hair was the way it always is except maybe a little more brushed out it was the way she was looking at everything but me with her shoulders back and her chin out and her eyes flashing we probably only stood there for five seconds but it felt like a year finally i said hi juli her eyes flashed at me and thats when it sank in she was mad she whispered i heard you and garrett making fun of my uncle in the library and i dont want to speak to you you understand me not now not ever my mind was racing where had she been i hadnt seen her anywhere near me in the library and had she heard it or had
Document 41
she heard it from somebody else i tried to tell her it wasnt me that it was garrett all garrett but she shut me down and made tracks for the front room to be with her dad so im standing there wishing id punched garrett out in the library so juli wouldnt stick me in the same class as someone who makes retard jokes when my dad shows up and claps me on the shoulder so hows the party son speak of the devil i wanted to whack his hand off my shoulder he leans out so he can see into the front room and says hey the dad cleans up pretty good doesnt he i shrug away from him mr bakers name is robert dad yeah you know i knew that he rubs his hands together and says i guess i ought to go in and say hello coming nah mom probably needs my help i didnt run off to the kitchen though i stood there and watched mr baker shake my fathers hand and as they stood there pumping and smiling this weird feeling started coming over me again not about juli about my father standing next to mr baker he looked small physically small and compared to the cut of mr bakers jaw my dads face looked kind of weaselly this is not the way you want to feel about your father when i was little id always thought that my dad was right about everything and that there wasnt a man on earth he couldnt take but standing there looking in i realized that mr baker could squash him like a bug worse though was the way he was acting watching my dad chum it up with julis dadit was like seeing him lie to mr baker to juli to my grandfatherto everybody why was he being such a worm why couldnt he just act normal you know civil why did he have to put on such a phony show this went way beyond keeping the peace with my mother this was disgusting and people said i was the spitting image of my father how often had i heard that one id never thought about it much but now it was turning my stomach mom jingled the dinner bell and called hors doeuvres are ready and then saw me still standing in the hallway bryce whered your sister and the boys go i shrugged down to her room i think go tell them would you and then come have some hors doeuvres sure i said anything to get rid of the taste in my mouth lynettas door was closed and normally i would have knocked and called mom wants you or dinner or something but in that split second before my knuckles hit wood my hand became possessed by evil baby brother i turned the knob and walked right in does lynetta freak out or throw stuff at me and scream for me to get out no she ignores me mattandmike give me a nod and lynetta sees me but shes got her hands over some headphones and her whole bodys bobbing up and down as she listens to a portable cd player mattormike whispers its about over well be right there like of course i was there to say it was time to eat what else would i be doing there something about that made me feel i dont know left out i wasnt even a person to those guys i was just baby brother nothing new there but now it really bugged me like all of a sudden i didnt fit in anywhere not at school not at home and every time i turned around another person id known forever felt like a stranger to me even i felt like a stranger to me standing around eating little round crackers smeared with whipped cheese and fish eggs didnt do much for my mood either my mother was acting like an entire swarm of busy bees she was everywhere in the kitchen out of the kitchen serving drinks handing out napkins explaining the food but not eating a thing lynetta didnt buy moms explanation on the hors doeuvres she wound up dissecting hers categorizing the parts into gross disgusting and hanging near her didnt stop the baker boys from shoving crackers in whole though man i was just waiting for them to wrap themselves around a table leg and flex juli her dad and my grandfather were off to the side talking nonstop about something and my dad was over with mrs baker looking about as stupid as i felt standing by myself talking to no one my mom flutters over to me and says you doing okay honey yeah i tell her but she forces me over to where granddad is anyway go on go on she whispers dinner will be ready in a minute so i stand there and the group of them opens up but its more like a reflex than anything no one says a word to me they just keep right on talking about perpetual motion perpetual motion my friend i didnt even know what perpetual motion was they were talking closed systems open systems resistance energy source magnetism it was like joining a discussion in a different language and juli juli was saying stuff like well what if you put the magnets back to back reversed the polarity like she really understood what they were talking about then my granddad and her dad would explain why her idea wouldnt work but all that did was make juli ask another question i was completely lost and even though i was pretending to follow along with what they were saying what i was really doing was trying not to stare at juli when my mom called us for dinner i did my best to pull juli aside and apologize to her but she gave me the cold shoulder and who could
Document 42
blame her really i sat down across from her feeling pretty low why hadnt i said something to garrett in the library i didnt have to punch him why hadnt i just told him he was out of line after mom served everyone their food dad seemed to decide that he ought to be the one directing the conversation so mike and matt he says youre seniors this year amen they say together amen as in youre glad high schools over absolutely my father starts twirling his fork whys that matt and mike look at each other then back at my dad the regurgitation gets to you after a while isnt that funny he says looking around the table high school was probably the best time of my life mattormike says seriously dude its totally lame mrs baker shoots him a look but that doesnt stop him well it is mom its that whole robotron attitude of education confine confute conformive had totally enough of that scene my dad eyes my mom with a little itoldyouso grin then says to matt and mike so i take it college is out of the question god what was with him in a flash i was clutching my fork and knife ready to duke it out for a couple of guys who pinched my cheeks and called me baby brother i took a deep breath and tried to relax tried to dive down to calmer water this wasnt my fight besides matt and mike seemed cool with it oh no they said college is a total possibility yeah we got accepted a couple of places but were going to give the music thing a shot first oh the music thing my father says matt and mike look at each other then shrug and get back to eating but lynetta glares at him and says your sarcasm is not appreciated dad lyn lyn says mattormike its cool everyones like that about it its a showmedont tellme thing thats a great idea lynetta says jumping out of her seat and dashing down the hall mom freezes not sure what to do about lynetta but then mrs baker says dinner is absolutely delicious patsy thanks trina its its nice to have all of you over theres about three seconds of quiet and then lynetta comes in and jabs at the cd player buttons until the drawer slides back in lyn no not a good idea says mattormike yeah lyn its not exactly dinner music tough says lynetta and cranks the volume boom whack boomboom whack the candles practically shake in their holders then guitars rip through the air and about blow them out matt and mike look up at the speakers then grin at each other and call over to my dad surround sound awesome setup mr loski all the adults were dying to jump up and turn the thing down but lynetta stood guard and just glowered at them and when the songs over lynetta pulls out the cd punches off the player and then smiles actually smiles at matt and mike and says that is the raddest song i want to hear it again and again and again mattormike says to my dad you probably dont like it but its what we do you boys wrote that song uhhuh he motions lynetta to pass the cd over saying just the one song mattormike laughs and says dude weve got a thousand songs but theres only three on the demo dad holds up the cd this is the demo yeah he looks at it a minute and says so if youre piss poor how do you afford to press cds dad lynetta snaps at him its okay lyn just a joke right mr loski my dad laughs a little and says right but then adds although i am a little curious this is obviously not a homedone demo and i happen to know studio times costprohibitive for most bands matt and mike interrupt him with a slamming hard high five and while im getting uptight about my dad asking them questions about money of all things my moms fumbling all over herself trying to sweep away my dads big pawprints when rick and i met he was playing in a band poached salmon was suddenly swimming down the wrong hatch and while im choking lynettas bugging out her raccoon eyes gasping you played in a band what did you play clarinet no honey my mom says trying to hold it all together your father played guitar guitar cool mattormike says rock country jazz country my dad says which is nothing to scoff at boys dude we know total respect man and when our band looked into getting a demo made it was astronomically expensive that was in a big city where there was a little competition getting a demo made around here i didnt even know there was a facility matt and mike are still grinning theres not so whered you go and howd you afford it my mother whacks him under the table again so he says im just curious patsy matt and mike lean in we did it ourselves this right here you did this yourselves thats impossible hes looking almost mad about it howd you get the gear my mom kicks him again but dad turns on her and says stop it would you im just curious mattormike says its cool mrs loski he smiles at my dad and says we kept cruising the internet and the trades looking for a deal everyones blowing out their old analog gear for digital because thats the move everyone else has made digital if you want to know our opinion is weak you lose too much of the waveform theres not enough fat to it and obviously we like it beefy my granddad puts up a finger and says but a cds digital so exactly but that is the last and only step well compromise
Document 43
on its just a necessity of being part of the industry everyone wants cds but the multitrack and the mixdown to twotrack is analog and we could afford it mr loski because we got used gear and weve been saving up our pennies since we were twelve years old he grins and says you still play we could you know lay down some of your tunes if you want my dad looks down and for a second i couldnt tell if he was going to get mad or cry then he sort of snorts and says thanks but thats not me anymore which was probably the only honest thing my dad said all night after that he was quiet hed try to plaster up a smile now and then but man underneath it he was broody and i was feeling kind of bad for him was he thinking about the good old days playing in a band i tried picturing him in cowboy boots and a cowboy hat with a guitar strapped across his shoulder playing some old willie nelson song he was right it just wasnt him but the fact that it ever had been made me feel even more like a stranger in a strange land then when the night was over and the bakers were piling out the front door something else strange happened juli touched my arm and for the first time that night she was looking at me it was that look too channeled directly and solely at me she says im sorry i was so angry when we first came in everyone had a good time and i think your moms really nice for inviting us her voice was quiet almost a whisper i just stood there like a moron staring at her bryce she says touching my arm again did you hear me im sorry i managed a nod but my arm was tingling and my heart was pounding and i felt myself pulling toward her then she was gone out the door and into the night part of a chorus of happy goodbyes i tried to catch my breath what was that what was wrong with me my mother closed the door and said there now what did i tell you that is one delightful family those boys are nothing like i expected lynetta why didnt you tell me they were soso charming theyre drug dealers is what they are everyone turned to my father and dropped their jaws what my mother said there is no other way those boys could afford to buy recording gear like that he glared at lynetta isnt that so lynettas eyes looked like they were going to pop right out of her head rick please my mother said you cant just make accusations like that its the only thing that makes sense patsy believe me i know how musicians are there is no other explanation for this lynetta shouted i happen to know for a fact that they dont use or deal where do you get off saying something like that you are such a twofaced condescending narrowminded jackass there was a split second of silence and then he slapped her smack right across the cheek that put my mother in his face like id never seen and sent my sister screaming insults over her shoulder as she ran down to her room my heart was pounding lynetta was right and i almost almost got in his face too and told him so but then my granddad pulled me aside and we both retreated to our own little corners of the house pacing around my room i had the urge to go talk to lynetta to tell her that she was right that dad was way out of line but i could hear her through the walls crying and screaming while my mom tried to calm her down then she stormed out of the house to whoknowswhere and my mom took up with my dad again so i stayed put and even though the earth quit quaking around eleven oclock there were tremors out there i could feel them as i lay in my bed staring out the window at the sky i thought about how my dad had always looked down on the bakers how hed put down their house and their yard and their cars and what they did for a living how hed called them trash and made fun of mr bakers paintings and now i was seeing that there was something really cool about that family all of them they were justreal and who were we there was something spinning wickedly out of control inside this house it was like seeing inside the bakers world had opened up windows into our own and the view was not a pretty one where had all this stuff come from and why hadnt i ever seen it before the dinner by the time i got home i knew it would be selfish of me to boycott the loskis dinner party my mother had already spent a lot of time humming over pie recipes and going through her closet for something suitable to wear shed even bought a new shirt for dad and had scrutinized what the boys intended to wear obviously she was looking forward to the dinner not that i really understood that but i didnt want to ruin everything by telling her about my newfound hatred of bryce and dad felt bad enough about david already the last thing he needed was to hear about crackpot comments made by immature eighth graders so that night i went through the motions of baking pies with my mother and convinced myself that i was doing the right thing one dinner couldnt change anyones life i just had to get through it friday at school i avoided the blueeyed brat the best i could but that night as i got dressed i found myself staring at
Document 44
the painting my father had given me and became furious all over again bryce had never been a friend to me ever he hadnt made a stand for the tree hed thrown away my eggs and hed made fun of me at my uncles expense why was i playing along like we were jolly friends and neighbors when my mother called that it was time to go i went out in the hall with every intention of telling her that i would not could not go to the loskis for dinner but she looked so lovely and happy that i couldnt i just couldnt i took a deep breath wrapped up a pie and shuffled across the street behind my brothers and parents chet answered the door maybe i shouldve been mad at him too for telling the loskis about my uncle but i wasnt i hadnt asked him not to tell and he certainly wasnt the one making fun of david mrs loski came up behind chet whisked us in and fluttered about and even though she had quite a bit of makeup on i was surprised to see the blueness of bags beneath her eyes then mrs loski and my mother went off with the pies my brothers vanished down the hall with lynetta and my father followed chet into the living room and wasnt that just dandy that left me alone in the foyer with bryce he said hi to me and i lost it i spun on him snapping dont you speak to me i overheard you and garrett in the library and i dont want to talk to you now or ever i started to walk into the living room but he stopped me juli juli wait he whispered im not the bad guy here that was garrett that was all garrett i glared at him i know what i heard no no you dont i i was feeling bad about you know the eggs and what id said about your yard i didnt know anything about your uncle or what kind of situation your family was in okay i just wanted to talk to someone about it our eyes locked for a minute and for the first time the blueness of his didnt freeze up my brain i heard you laugh he made a joke about me being a retard and you laughed juli you dont understand i wanted to punch him really i did but we were in the library so instead you laughed he shrugged and looked miserable and sheepish yeah i left him just walked into the living room and left him if he was making it up he was quite an actor if he was telling the truth then chet was right he was a coward either way i didnt want to be anywhere near him i stood beside my father and tried to follow his discussion with chet about something theyd both read in the paper my father was saying but what hes proposing would require a perpetualmotion machine so its not possible chet replied maybe in the context of what scientists know now but do you rule it out completely at that moment i was feeling absolutely no scientific curiosity but in a desperate attempt to block bryce loski from my mind i asked whats a perpetualmotion machine my father and chet glanced at each other chuckled then shrugged giving me the sense that theyd just agreed to let me into a secret club my father explained its a machine that runs without any external power source no electricity no fuel no water propulsion nothing chet glanced over my shoulder and asked rather absently you think thats a doable thing what had distracted him was bryce still in the foyer why didnt he just go away i forced myself to focus on the conversation do i think thats a doable thing well i dont really know all machines use energy right even real efficient ones and that energy has to come from somewhere what if the machine generated it itself chet asked but one eye was still on the foyer how could it do that neither of them answered me instead my father stuck out his hand and said good evening rick nice of you to have us over mr loski pumped my dads hand and joined our group making little comments about the weather when that topic was all dried up he said and wow that yard of yours has really come along i told chet here that we ought to hire him out he really knows his pickets doesnt he he was joking i think but my father didnt take it that way and neither did chet i was afraid of what might happen next but then mrs loski tinkled a little dinner bell and called hors doeuvres everybody the hors doeuvres were delicious but when my father whispered that the teenytiny black berries on top of the crackers werent berries at all but caviar i stopped midbite fish eggs repulsive then my father pointed out that i ate chicken eggs all the time so why get squeamish over fish eggs he had a point i hesitantly finished the cracker and before long i was having another bryce was standing all by himself across the room and every time i happened to look his way he was staring at me finally i completely turned my back on him and said to my father so whos trying to invent a perpetualmotion machine anyway my father laughed mad scientists all over the world really yes for hundreds of years well what do they do whats one look like it wasnt long before chet was in on the discussion and just as i was finally starting to catch on to magnetism gyroscopic particles and zeropoint energy i felt someone standing behind me it was bryce i could feel my cheeks flush with anger couldnt he see i wanted to
Document 45
be left alone i took a step away from him but what that did was open up the group and allow him to move forward now he was standing in our circle listening to our discussion well surely he was not interested in perpetual motion i barely was myself so i reasoned continuing our discussion would drive him away i dove back in and when the conversation started to peter out i came up with my own ideas on perpetualmotion machines i was like a perpetualidea machine spinning ridiculous suggestions right out of the air and still he wouldnt leave he didnt say anything he just stood there listening then when mrs loski announced that dinner was ready bryce held my arm and whispered juli im sorry ive never been so sorry about anything in my whole life youre right i was a jerk and im sorry i yanked my arm free from his grasp and said it seems to me youve been sorry about a whole lot of things lately and left him there with his apology hanging wounded in the air it didnt take me long to realize that id made a mistake i should have let him say he was sorry and then simply continued to ignore him but id snapped at him in the middle of an apology which somehow made me the rude one i sneaked a peek at him across the table but he was watching his dad who was asking my brothers about graduating and their plans for college i had of course seen mr loski many times but usually from a distance still it seemed impossible that id never noticed his eyes before they were blue brilliant blue and although mr loskis were set farther back and were hidden somewhat by his eyebrows and cheekbones there was no mistaking where bryce had gotten his eyes his hair was black too like bryces and his teeth were white and straight even though chet had called bryce the spitting image of his father id never really thought of them as looking alike but now i saw that they did look alike though where his dad seemed kind of smug bryce seemed well right now he seemed angry then from the other side of the table i heard your sarcasm is not appreciated dad mrs loski gave a small gasp and everyone looked at lynetta well its not she said in all the years weve lived across the street from the loskis ive said about ten words to lynetta and shes said fewer back to me shes scary so it wasnt a surprise to see her glaring at her father but it was uncomfortable mrs loski was keeping a smile perched on her face but she was blinking a lot glancing nervously around the table i looked from one person to the next too wondering if dinner at the loskis was always this tense suddenly lynetta got up and dashed down the hall but she was back in a flash with a cd in her hand and when she put it in the player i recognized one of my brothers songs blaring through the speakers wed heard this song candle ice pouring out of my brothers bedroom at least a million times so we were used to it but i looked over at my mom worried that she might be embarrassed by the distorting guitars and the gritty lyrics this was definitely not caviar music she seemed a little uncertain but in a happy way she was sharing secret smiles with my father and honestly i think she even giggled my dad was looking amused although he was very reserved about it and it took me until the end of the song to realize that he was proud proud that this noise came from his boys that surprised me dad has never been real big on any rendition of my brothers band although hes never really criticized it either but then mr loski started grilling matt and mike about how theyd afforded to record their own music and they explained about working and saving and shopping for good deals on equipment and thats when i realized why my father was proud my brothers were feeling pretty good too you could tell and it was no wonder with the way lynetta was carrying on about how great candle ice was she was positively gushing which seemed very odd coming from lynetta as i looked around it struck me that we were having dinner with a group of strangers wed lived across the street for years but i didnt know these people at all lynetta did know how to smile mr loski was clean and smooth on the outside but there was a distinct whiff of something rotten buried just beneath the surface and the everefficient mrs loski seemed flustered almost hyper was it having us over that was making her nervous then there was brycethe most disturbing of all because i had to admit that i didnt really know him either and based on what id discovered lately i didnt care to know any more looking across the table at him all i got was a strange detached neutral feeling no fireworks no leftover anger or resurging flutters nothing after wed had dessert and it was time to go i went up to bryce and told him i was sorry for having been so fierce when wed first come in i shouldve let you apologize and really it was very nice of your family to have us over i know it was a lot of work and well i think my mom had a really good time and thats what matters to me we were looking right at each other but it was almost as though he didnt hear me bryce i said im sorry he nodded and then our families were waving goodbye and saying good night i walked behind my mother who was holding
Document 46
hands with my father and beside my brothers who were carrying home what was left of our pies we all wound up in the kitchen and matt poured himself a glass of milk and said to mike that mr loski was sniffing us out pretty good tonight wasnt he no kidding maybe he thinks were hot for his daughter not me dude you mike got himself a glass of milk too thats skylers gig no way id go there he grinned but she was really cool tonight did she come down on papa bear or what my dad took a paper plate out of the cupboard and cut a slice of pie you boys showed a lot of restraint tonight i dont know if i couldve kept my cool that way aw hes just you know entrenched matt said gotta adjust to the perspective and deal from there then he added not that id want him as my dad mike practically sprayed his milk dude can you imagine then matt gave my dad a slap on the back and said no way im sticking with my main man here my mom grinned from across the kitchen and said me too id never seen my father cry and he didnt exactly sit there bawling but there were definitely tears welling up in his eyes he blinked them back the best he could and said dont you boys want some pie to go with that milk dude said matt as he straddled a chair i was just thinking that yeah mike added im starved get me a plate too i called as mike dug through the cupboard but we just ate my mother cried come on trina have some pie its delicious i went to bed that night feeling very full and very happy and as i lay there in the dark i wondered at how much emotion can go into any given day and thought how nice it was to feel this way at the end of it and as i nestled in and drifted off to sleep my heart felt wonderfully free the next morning i still felt good i went outside and sprinkled the yard enjoying the splish and patter of water on soil wondering when when that first little blade of grass would spring up into the sunshine then i went out back cleaned the coop raked the yard and dug up some of the bigger weeds growing along the edges mrs stueby leaned over the side fence as i was shoveling my rakings and weeds into a trash can and said hows it going julianna making neat for a rooster a rooster why certainly those hens need some motivation to start laying more it was true bonnie and clydette and the others were only laying about half the eggs that they used to but a rooster i dont think the neighborhood would appreciate my getting a rooster mrs stueby besides wed get chicks and i dont think we can handle any more poultry back here nonsense youve spoiled these birds giving them the whole yard they can share the space easily how else are you going to maintain your business soon those birds wont be laying anything atall they wont well very little i shook my head then said they were just my chicks that grew into chickens and started laying eggs i never really thought of it as a business well my runnin a tab has probably contributed to that and im sorry ill be sure and get you the whole sum this week but consider buying yourself a rooster with some of it ive got a friend down on newcomb street who is positively green over my deviled eggs i gave her my recipe but she says hers just dont taste the same she winked at me im certain shed pay handsomely for a supply of my secret ingredient if it became available she turned to go then said bytheby julianna you have done a mighty fine job on that front yard most impressive thanks mrs stueby i called as she slid open her patio door thanks very much i finished scooping up the piles id made and thought about what mrs stueby had said should i really get a rooster id heard that having one around made chickens lay more whether they were in contact with each other or not i could even breed my chickens and get a whole new set of layers but did i really want to go through all of that again not really i didnt want to be the neighborhood rancher if my girls quit laying altogether that would be just fine with me i put away the rake and shovel clucked a kiss on each of the hens and went inside it felt good to take charge of my own destiny i felt strong and right and certain little did i know how a few days back at school would change all of that flipped after the dinner juli was nice to me at school which i hated mad was better than nice gaga was better than nice it was like i was a stranger to her and man it bugged me bugged me bigtime then the auction happened and i found myself with even bigger problems the auction is this bogus way the booster club raises money for the school they insist its an honor to be chosen but bullstinkinloney to that bottom line is twenty guys get shanghaied they have to come up with fancy picnic lunches and then be humiliated in front of the whole school while girls bid to have lunch with them guess who made this years top twenty youd think mothers would say hey theres no way youre going to auction my son off to the highest bidder but no instead theyre all flattered that their sons been elected a basket boy yes my friend thats what they call you over the
Document 47
pa you hear stuff like there will be an organizational meeting of the newly elected basket boys in the mpr at lunch today all basket boys must attend pretty soon youve completely lost your name you and nineteen other saps are known simply as basket boy my mom of course was into it coming up with all sorts of stuff to put in my basket so id get the highest bid i tried to explain that i didnt want to be in mayfield junior highs basket boy hall of fame and that really what was in the basket didnt matter it wasnt like girls were bidding on the basket when you got right down to it this was a meat market you eat lunch on campus and thats the end of it it is hardly a meat market bryce its an honor besides maybe someone really nice will bid on you and youll make a new friend mothers can be in such denial and then garrett bends my ear with the news that shelly stalls is breaking up with mitch michaelson and that she miranda humes and jenny atkinson are starting some bidding war over me dude he tells me the two hottest chicks on campus and i swear to god man shellys dumped mitch because of you i heard it direct from shagreer and dude shagreer the ear knows all he throws me this nasty grin and says me im rooting for jumbo jenny it would serve you right for being such a basket boy i told him to shut up but he was right with the way my luck was running id probably get stuck with jumbo jenny i could just see it six feet of beefy babe downing both halves of my lunch and then coming after me jennys the only girl or guy on campus who can dunk a basketball the whole gym shakes when she lands and since shes got no you know female parabolas the girl could shave her head and make it in the nba seriously no one would ever suspect her parents give her anything she wants too rumor has it they converted their garage into a fullon basketball court just for her which meant that in the game of the basket boys i was as good as slamdunked unless unless shelly or miranda was high bidder but how could i make sure that happened my brain went into overdrive constructing a plan and in the end i decided that there was only one sensible course of action kiss up to both of them halfway through my first day of doing this i felt like a skunk not that i was being gross about it or anything i was just you know friendly and even though shelly and miranda didnt seem to smell a thing garrett did dude he says to me on thursday i can see your game man what are you talking about dont deny it dude youre working them both he comes up and whispers in my ear basket boy or not im in awe shut up man seriously the ear says they were like clawing each other in pe today i had to know what about jumbo jenny he shrugs havent heard but well find out tomorrow wont we dude my mother dropped me off at school on friday with my stupid oversized picnic basket and since all basket boys have to dress up i was choking in a tie and feeling completely dweeblike in slacks and dress shoes kids whistled and shouted oooh baby as i headed up the walkway and then jumbo jenny passed me taking the front steps three at a time wow bryce she said over her shoulder you look delicious oh man i practically ran to the classroom where all the basket boys were supposed to meet and the minute i walked in i felt better i was surrounded by other dweebs who seemed genuinely happy to see me hey loski yo dude doesnt this suck eggs why didnt you take the bus man misery loves company then mrs mcclure the president of the boosters the lady who lassoed us all hoofs it through the door oh my she says you all look so handsome not one word about our baskets not one little sneak peek inside no for all she cared those puppies were empty meat market you better believe it dont be so nervous boys mrs mcclure was saying youre going to have a wonderful day she pulls out a list of names and starts ordering us into line we get numbers our baskets get numbers we fill out threebyfive cards to her insane specifications and by the time shes got us all organized and is sure we know what to do and what not to do weve missed all of first and most of second period okay gentlemen she says leave your baskets where they are and go to where are we now still in second she looks at the clock right second what about passes some sensible basket boy asked your teachers have a list but if they say anything tell them i say your neckties are your passes ill meet you back here when everyones dismissed for the auction got it dont dawdle we grumbled yeah yeah and headed to class and i can tell you this not one of the twenty of us listened to a word any of our teachers said that morning how can you listen with a noose around your neck pinched toes and a room full of idiots thinking its open season on basket boys whoever started this stupid tradition ought to be crammed into a basket and tossed downstream without a serving spoon i was basket boy number nine which meant i had to stand there on the stage in the gym while nearly half the guys got auctioned off minimum bid ten bucks and if nobody bid the secret was a
Document 48
teacher was assigned to bid on you yes my friend the possibilities for mortification were infinite some of the moms showed up and stood off to the side with their camcorders and zoom lenses fidgeting and waving and basically acting as dweeby as their sons looked i should know my mom took an hour off work to be one of them tim pello was basket boy number five and his mom actually bid on him no kidding she jumped up and down yelling twenty ill give you twenty man thatll brand you for life lucky for tim kelly trott came up with twentytwo fifty and saved his sorry self from everlasting torture as a mamas boy one of the few fates worse than basket boy caleb hughes was up next and he fetched the boosters all of eleven fifty then came chad ormonde who i swear was ready to pee his pants when mrs mcclure made him step forward she read his card pinched his cheeks and raked in fifteen even at this point what stood between me and the auction block was jon trulock and i wasnt exactly interested in what he had in his basket or what his hobbies and favorite sports were i was too busy scanning the crowd for jumbo jenny sweating my pits off mrs mcclure calls into the microphone do i hear ten and it took me a minute to tune in to the fact that no one said ten no one said anything come on out there the lunch is delicious strawberry tarts um and mrs mcclure goes back to reading off the threebyfive about jon trulocks lunch talk about embarrassing this was worse than being a mamas boy worse than lunch with jumbo jenny howd he get voted basket boy if nobody wanted to have lunch with him then off to the right of the crowd i hear ten ten did i hear ten mrs mcclure says with a fluttery smile twelve came a different voice from the same area the first voice came back with fifteen and all of a sudden i recognized whose voice it was juli bakers i searched through the crowd and found her hand waving in the air that look all over her face sixteen came the other voice there was a pause but then juli shoots back with eighteen eighteen cries mrs mcclure who looks like shes about to collapse from relief she pauses then says eighteen going once eighteen going twice sold for eighteen dollars to juli she was the last person i expected to bid on a lunch anybodys lunch jon staggered back into line and i knew i was supposed to step forward but i couldnt budge i felt like id been slugged in the stomach did juli like jon is that why shed been soso nice lately because she didnt care about me anymore all my life shed been there waiting to be avoided and now it was like i didnt even exist step up bryce come on dont be shy mike abenido shoved me a little and said your turn for torture get up there it felt like walking the plank i just stood up front sweating bullets while the booster queen dissected my lunch and started running through my list of favorites before shes even finished though shelly stalls calls out ten whats that says mrs mcclure ill give you ten oh she laughs as she puts down her notes well i guess i hear ten twenty calls miranda humes from dead center twentyfive its shelly again im looking around for jumbo jenny praying shes gone home sick or something while shelly and miranda go up by fives thirty thirtyfive forty then i spot her shes about twenty feet behind miranda cleaning her fingernails with her teeth fortyfive fifty fiftytwo fiftytwo interrupts the booster queen well this has been lively and from the looks of this basket well worth the sixty sixtytwo calls shelly miranda scrambles around trying to beg money off her friends as mrs mcclure calls going once but then jenny stands up and bellows a hundred a hundred theres a collective gasp and then the entire student body turns and stares at jenny well laughs mrs mcclure we have a hundred that is certainly an alltime record and such a generous donation to the boosters i wanted to boost her right off the stage i was doomed this was something i would never live down then theres this big commotion and all of a sudden shelly and miranda are standing right next to each other calling onetwentytwo fifty well give you onetwentytwo fifty one hundred twentytwo dollars and fifty cents i thought the booster queen was gonna polka youre pooling your resources to have lunch with this fine young man yeah they call then look over jennys way everybody looks over jennys way jenny just shrugs and goes back to cleaning a nail well then one hundred twentytwo dollars and fifty cents going once one hundred twentytwo dollars and fifty cents going twice sold to those two beautiful young ladies for an alltime record of one hundred twentytwo dollars and fifty cents dude mike whispered when i got back in line shelly and miranda how am i supposed to follow that he didnt even come close he got terry norris for sixteen bucks and the most anyone else got was forty and when it was over all the guys told me dude you are like the man score but i didnt feel like the man i felt wiped out my mom came up and gave me a hug and a kiss like id won a gold medal or something then whispered my little baby and clickityclicked off in her high heels back to work so i was wiped out embarrassed and then practically dragged to the multipurpose room by shelly and miranda the boosters had outfitted the mpr with little tables for two all decorated in shades
Document 49
of pink and blue and yellow with balloons and streamers everywhere i felt like the easter bunny with my stupid basket boy lunch clutched in both hands while miranda held on to one arm and shelly latched on to the other they gave us the biggest table and whisked in an extra chair and when everyone was seated mrs mcclure said boys and girls i dont think i need to remind you that you are excused from class for the rest of the day enjoy your lunches enjoy your friendships take your time relax and thanks again for supporting your boosters we wouldnt be us without you so there i was with the two hottest girls on campus having lunch i was the man the envy of every other guy in school buddy i was miserable i mean these two girls may be gorgeous but what was coming out of their mouths about jumbo jenny was embarrassingly ugly miranda works herself up to what was she thinking like you would ever want to go out with her right bryce well yeah that was right but it seemed really wrong to say so look can we talk about something else sure like what i dont care anything else you guys going anywhere this summer miranda shoots off first were taking a cruise to the mexican riviera were supposed to stop in all these cool ports and shop and stuff she flutters her eyelids at me and says i could bring you something back shelly scoots her chair in a little and says were going up to the lake my dad has a cabin there and you can get the most outrageous tan do you remember what i looked like at the beginning of this year i was like black im going to do that again only this time ive got a schedule all worked out so that its even every where she giggles and says dont tell my mom okay she would have a kanip and this my friend is how the tan wars began miranda told shelly that she didnt even notice her tan at the beginning of the year and that the place to really roast is on a cruise ship shelly told miranda that anyone with freckles cant really get tan and since miranda had freckles everywhere the cruise was a guaranteed waste of money i choked down my third of the lunch and looked around the room trying to let it all flow past me then i saw juli she was two tables away from me facing my direction only she wasnt looking at me she was looking at jon her eyes all sparkly and laughing my heart lurched what was she laughing about what were they talking about how could she sit there and look so beautiful i felt myself spinning out of control it was weird like i couldnt even steer my own body id always thought jon was pretty cool but right then i wanted to go over and throw him across the room shelly grabbed my arm and said bryce are you all right you looki dont know possessed or something what oh i tried taking a deep breath what are you staring at miranda asked they both looked over their shoulders then shrugged and went back to picking at their food but i couldnt stop myself from looking again and in the back of my mind i could hear my grandfathers voice saying the choices you make now will affect you for the rest of your life do the right thing do the right thing do the right thing miranda shook me out of it asking bryce are you in there i asked what are you going to do this summer i dont know i snapped hey maybe you can spend some time up at the lake with us shelly said it was torture i wanted to scream shut up leave me alone i wanted to run out of the building and keep on running until i didnt feel like this anymore lunch is really delicious bryce mirandas voice was floating around bryce did you hear me this is really a spectacular lunch a simple little thank you wouldve sufficed but could i come up with a simple little thank you no i turned on her and said can we not talk about food or tans or hair she gave me an uppity little smile well what do you want to talk about then i blinked at her then at shelly how about perpetual motion know anything about that perpetual what miranda starts laughing what i ask her whats so funny she looks at me a minute then snickers i didnt realize id bid on an intellectual hey im plenty smart yeah miranda giggles can you spell intellectual he is too smart miranda oh stop kissing up shelly youre trying to tell me youre after his brain god its making me sick to watch you grovel grovel excuse me you heard me hes not going to take you to the grad dance anyway so just give it up why dont you and with that it was all over one of my moms flaky apple tarts got ground into mirandas hair the extra ranch dressing got smeared into shellys and before mrs mcclure could say in the name of boosters what are you doing they were rolling on the floor scratching each others makeup off i took this opportunity to leave my table and head for julis i grabbed her by the hand and said ive got to talk to you she sort of halfstands and says what whats going on bryce why are they fighting excuse us a minute would you jon i pull her away from the table but theres no place to go and ive got her hand in mine and i just cant think so i stop right there in the middle of the room and look at her
Document 50
at that face i want to touch her cheek and see what it feels like i want to touch her hair it looks so incredibly soft bryce she whispers whats wrong i can barely breathe as i ask her do you like him do i you mean jon yes well sure hes nice and no do you like him my heart was pounding through my chest as i took her other hand and waited well no i mean not like that no she said no i didnt care where i was i didnt care who saw i wanted just had to kiss her i leaned in closed my eyes and then she broke away from me suddenly the room was dead quiet miranda and shelly stared at me through their slimy hair everyone was looking at me like id blown my entire circuit board and i just stood there trying to reel in my lips and pull myself back together mrs mcclure took me by the shoulders guided me to my chair and told me you sit here and you stay here then she hauled miranda and shelly outside scolding them and telling them to find separate bathrooms and clean up while she ran down the janitor to mop up their mess i sat there by myself and didnt even care about covering up i just wanted to be with her to talk to her to hold her hand again to kiss her before school was out i tried to talk to her again but every time i got close shed dodge me and then when the final bell rang she disappeared i looked everywhere for her but she was just gone garrett however wasnt he tracked me down and said dude tell me it isnt true i didnt say a word i just headed for the bike racks still hoping to find juli oh man it is true leave me alone garrett you get hooked up with the two finest chicks on campus then bail on them for juli you dont understand youre right dude i completely dont understand did you seriously try to kiss her i couldnt believe that part were talking julianna baker your nightmare neighbor the knowitall nuisance the coop poop babe i stopped cold and shoved him just laid into him with both hands and shoved that was a long time ago man knock it off garrett put both hands up but moved in at me dude you have flipped you know that just back off would you he blocked my path i cant believe this two hours ago you were the man the man the whole school was on their knees before you now look at you youre like a social hazard he snorted and said and dude the truth is if youre gonna be like this i dont need the association i got right in his face and said good cause you know what neither do i i shoved him aside and ran i wound up walking home in my pinchy shoes with dirty dishes clanking inside my sticky picnic hamper this basket boy hiked all the way home and there was a battle raging inside me the old bryce wanted to go back in time wanted to hang with garrett and shoot the breeze wanted to hate juli baker again wanted to be the man but in my heart i knew the old bryce was toast there was no going back not to garrett or shelly or miranda or any of the other people who wouldnt understand juli was different but after all these years that didnt bother me anymore i liked it i liked her and every time i saw her she seemed more beautiful she just seemed to glow im not talking like a hundredwatt bulb she just had this warmth to her maybe it came from climbing that tree maybe it came from singing to chickens maybe it came from whacking at twobyfours and dreaming about perpetual motion i dont know all i know is that compared to her shelly and miranda seemed soordinary id never felt like this before ever and just admitting it to myself instead of hiding from it made me feel strong happy i took off my shoes and socks and stuffed them in the basket my tie whipped over my shoulder as i ran home barefoot and i realized that garrett was right about one thing i had flipped completely i trucked down our street and spotted her bike lying on its side on the driveway she was home i rang the bell until i thought it would break no answer i pounded on her door no answer i went home and called on the phone and finally finally her mother answers bryce no im sorry she doesnt want to talk then she whispers give her a little time wont you i gave her an hour almost then i went across the street please mrs baker ive got to see her shes locked herself in her room dear why dont you try phoning tomorrow tomorrow i couldnt wait until tomorrow so i went around the side of their house climbed the fence and knocked on her window juli juli please ive got to see you her curtains didnt open but the back door did and out came mrs baker to shoo me away when i got home my granddad was waiting at the front door bryce what is going on youve been running back and forth to the bakers climbing over their fence youre acting like the worlds on fire i blurted i cant believe this i just cant believe this she wont talk to me he led me into the front room saying who wont talk to you juli he hesitated is she mad at you i dont know does she have reason to be mad at you no yes i mean i dont know well what happened i tried to kiss her

its a joke he said its embarrassing who wants to be a basket boy all the guys around him muttered not me but mrs simmons cleared her throat and said you should want to be one its a tradition that has helped support the school since it was founded there have been generation after generation of basket boys helping make this campus what it is today its why we have flower beds its why we have shade trees and a grove of apple trees visit another junior high sometime and youll begin to realize what a little oasis our campus really is all this from the sweat and blood of basket boys robbie grumbled mrs simmons sighed robbie someday when your children go to school here youll understand for now please just vote for whoever you think will earn a high bid and class she added were down to nine minutes the room fell quiet and as i read down the list of over one hundred and fifty eighthgrade boys i realized that to me there had only ever been one boy to me there had only been bryce i didnt let myself get sentimental i had liked him for all the wrong reasons and i certainly wasnt going to vote for him now but i didnt know who else to vote for i looked at mrs simmons who was eagleeyeing the class between glances at the clock what if i didnt choose anybody what if i just turned it in blank shed give me detention thats what so with two minutes left to go i put dots next to the boys i knew who werent jerks or clowns but were just nice when i was through there were all of ten names with dots and of those i circled five ryan noll vince olson adrian iglesias ian lai and jon trulock they wouldnt make basket boy but then i wouldnt be bidding so it didnt really matter at the bell i handed over my ballot and forgot all about the auction until lunchtime the next day that is darla cut me off on my way to the library and dragged me over to her table instead have you seen the list she asked what list the list of basket boys she shoved a scrawled copy of twenty names in front of me and looked around your main dish is on it five from the top there it wasbryce loski i should have expected it but still this awful surge of possessiveness shot through me who had voted for him out of one hundred fifty names he must have gotten a lot of votes suddenly i was picturing a swarm of girls waving stacks of cash in the booster ladies faces as they begged to have lunch with him i threw the list back at darla and said hes not my main dish as a matter of fact i didnt even vote for him oooo girl you are stickin to your diet its not a diet darla im im over him okay im glad to hear it cause rumor is that bimbette shelly is already stakin her claim on him shelly shelly stalls i could feel my cheeks flush thats right darla waved her list in the air calling liz macy over here ive got the list darlas friends fell all over themselves getting to her then pored over the paper like it was a treasure map macy cried chad ormondes on it he is so cute id go ten bucks on him easy and dennys on it too liz squealed that boy is she shivered and giggledfiyiyine macys top lip curled a little and she said jon trulock jon tru lock how did he get on this list for a moment i couldnt believe my ears i snatched the paper out of macys hand are you sure right there she said pointing to his name who do you suppose voted for him the quiet girls i guess darla said me im more interested in mike abenido have i got any competition macy laughed if youre in im out me too said liz how about you jules darla asked me bringin spare change on friday no you get to miss the second half of school no im not bidding not on anyone she laughed good for you that afternoon i rode home from school brooding about bryce and the whole basket boy auction i could feel myself backsliding about bryce but why should i care if shelly liked him i shouldnt even be thinking about him when i wasnt thinking about bryce i was worrying about poor jon trulock he was quiet and i felt sorry for him having to clutch a basket and be auctioned off in front of the whole student body what had i done to him but as i bounced up our drive basket boys bounced right out of my mind was that green i saw poking out of the dirt yes yes it was i dropped the bike and got down on my hands and knees they were so thin so small so far apart they barely made a difference in the vastness of the black dirt and yet there they were pushing their way through to the afternoon sun i ran in the house calling mom mom theres grass really she emerged from the bathroom with her cleaning gloves and a pail i was wondering if it was ever going to spring up well it has come come and see she wasnt too impressed at first but after i made her get down on her hands and knees and really look she smiled and said theyre so delicate they look like theyre yawning dont they she cocked her head a bit and looked a little closer yawning well more stretching i guess like theyre sitting up in their little bed of dirt with their arms stretched way high saying good morning world she laughed

and said yes they do i got up and uncoiled the hose i think they need a wakeup shower dont you my mom agreed and left me to my singing and sprinkling and i was completely lost in the joy of my little green blades of new life when i heard the school bus rumble to a stop up on collier street bryce his name shot through my brain and with it came a panic i didnt seem able to control before i could stop myself i dropped the hose and dashed inside i locked myself in my room and tried to do my homework where was my peace where was my resolve where was my sanity had they left me because shelly stalls was after him was it just some old rivalry making me feel this way i had to get past bryce and shelly they deserved each otherlet them have each other but in my heart i knew that just like the new grass i wasnt strong enough yet to be walked on and until i was there was only one solution i had to stay away from him i needed to rope him out of my life so i closed my ears to the news of basket boys and steered clear of bryce at school and when i did happen to run into him i simply said hello like he was someone i barely even knew it was working too i was growing stronger by the day who cared about auctions and basket boys i didnt friday morning i got up early collected what few eggs there were in the coop watered the front yard which was by now definitely green ate breakfast and got ready for school but as i was running a brush through my hair i couldnt help thinking about shelly stalls it was auction day shed probably been up since five making her hair into some impossibly pouffy do so what i told myself so what but as i was throwing on my windbreaker i eyed my money tin and hesitated what if no nonono i ran to the garage got my bike and pushed out of the driveway and i was in the street and on my way when mrs stueby flew right in my path julianna she called waving her hand through the air here dear take this im so sorry its taken me this long to get it to you i keep missing you in the mornings i didnt even know how much she owed me at that moment i didnt care all i knew was the top bill in her hand was a ten and it was striking terror in my heart mrs stueby please i i dont want that you dont have to pay me nonsense child of course im going to pay you here she said and waved it out for me to take no really i i dont want it she wedged it in the pocket of my jeans and said what utter nonsense now go go buy yourself a rooster then hurried back up her walkway mrs stueby mrs stueby i called after her i dont want a rooster but she was gone all the way to school mrs stuebys money was burning a hole in my pocket and another in my brain how much was it when i got to school i parked my bike then broke down and looked ten fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen i folded the bills together and slid them back into my pocket was it more than shelly had all through first period i was furious with myself for even thinking it all through second period i kept my eyes off of bryce but oh it was so hard id never seen him in a tie and cuff links before then at break i was at my locker when shelly stalls appeared out of nowhere she got right next to me and said i hear youre planning to bid on him what i took a step back who told you that i am not someone said they saw you with a whole wad of cash this morning how much do you have its its none of your business and im not bidding okay i i dont even like him anymore she laughed oh thatll be the day its true i slammed my locker closed go ahead and waste your money on him i dont care i left her there with her mouth open which felt even better than getting her in a headlock that feeling carried me clear through to eleven oclock when the entire student body assembled in the gymnasium i was not going to bid on bryce loski no way then the basket boys came out on the stage bryce looked so adorable holding a picnic basket with redandwhitechecked napkins peeking out from either side and the thought of shelly stalls flipping one of those napkins into her lap nearly made the bills in my pocket burst into flames darla came up behind me and whispered rumor is youve got a wad of cash is that true what no i mean yes but i im not bidding oooo girl look at you you feelin all right i wasnt i felt sick to my stomach and shaky in the knees im fine i told her fine she looked from me to the stage and back to me you got nothin to lose but your self respect stop it i whispered at her fiercely it felt like i was having a panic attack i couldnt breathe i felt lightheaded and wobblylike i wasnt in control of my own body darla said maybe you should sit down im fine darla im fine she frowned at me i think ill stick around to make sure the booster club president mrs mcclure had been fluttering around the basket boys fixing ties and giving them lastminute instructions but now suddenly she was slamming her

gavel on the podium calling into the microphone if youll all settle down were ready to begin id never seen six hundred kids quiet down so fast i guess mrs mcclure hadnt either because she smiled and said why thank you thank you very much then she said and welcome to the fiftysecond annual basket boy auction i know that your teachers have gone over the procedures with you in homeroom but ive been asked to remind you of a few things this is a civilized proceeding no whistling catcalls or other degrading behavior will be tolerated if you wish to place a bid you must raise your hand high bidding without raising your hand is prohibited and should you decide to be a funny guy you will be caught and detained or suspended are we all clear on that good she looked from one side of the gym to the other teachers i see that you are in position six hundred heads turned slowly from side to side looking at the blockade of teachers on either side of the gym man darla whispered theyre not leaving much room for fun are they mrs mcclure continued minimum bid is ten dollars and of course the skys the limit but we dont accept ious she pointed to her right winning bidders should go directly to the table at the north door when i declare the basket to be sold and as youre aware winners and their basket boys have the rest of the school day off and are exempt from tonights homework in all classes she smiled out at the blockade teachers we appreciate your support on this all right then she put on her reading glasses and looked at a threebyfive card our first basket has been brought by jeffrey bisho she looked over her glasses at him and said come on up jeffrey dont be shy he inched forward as she continued jeffrey has brought a scrumptious lunch consisting of chicken salad sandwiches oriental noodles baby grapes iced tea and fortune cookies she smiled at him over her glasses sounds delicious and sounds like fun which she said looking back at the crowd jeffrey is he enjoys skateboarding skiing and swimming but ladies he also enjoys a day in the park and watching humphrey bogart movies she turned to him and grinned they are a kick arent they poor jeff tried to smile but you could tellhe wanted to die all right then said mrs mcclure as she whipped off her glasses do i hear ten not only did she hear ten she heard twelve fifteen twenty and twentyfive too going going gone cried mrs mcclure to the young lady in the purple tunic who is that i asked darla i think her names tiffany she said shes a seventh grader really wow i would never have bid last year and i i dont remember bids going up that high either darla eyed me which tells me that maybe you would bid this year how much you got i looked at her and almost dissolved right on the spot darla i didnt bring money on purpose my neighbor made me take it on the way to school because she owed it to me for eggs and for eggs oh like bryce was talking about in the library exactly and i looked at her looking at me and stopped cold how can you even think about bidding on that boy i dont want to but ive liked him for so long darla ive liked him since i was seven and even though i know hes a coward and a sneak and i should never speak to him again im having trouble focusing on that especially since shelly stalls is after him and now ive got this money burning a hole in my pocket well i can understand the bit about shelly stalls but if you know that boys just a big piece of fluffy cheesecake that youre gonna regret eating i can help you with your diet she put out her hand give me the money ill hold it for you no no i meani can handle this ive got to handle it she shook her head oh girl im hurting for you here i looked back at the stage the auction was happening so fast theyd be at bryce in no time as the bidding continued the battle in my head got louder and fiercer what was i going to do then suddenly the gym fell quiet you could have heard a pin drop and standing next to mrs mcclure looking completely mortified was jon trulock mrs mcclure was scouring the crowd with her eyes looking very uncomfortable too what happened i whispered to darla no ones bidding she whispered back do i hear ten called mrs mcclure come on out there this lunch is delicious strawberry tarts roast beef and muenster cheese sandwiches oh no i whispered to darla i cant believe i did this to him you what did you do i voted for him well you couldnt have been the only one but why isnt anyone bidding on him hes hes so nice darla nodded exactly thats when i realized what i had to do my hand shot into the air and i called ten ten warbled mrs mcclure did i hear ten i put my hand up higher and said to darla say twelve what say twelve ill outbid you no way darla he cant go for ten cmon twelve darla called but her hand didnt go up very high fifteen i cried sixteen called darla and eyed me with a laugh i whispered darla ive only got fifteen her eyes got enormous i laughed and called eighteen then held her arm

girl what a rush i nodded yes it was well no dessert for you looks like you got cleaned out by something a little more uh nutritious she nodded toward the stage you gonna go up to the table like youre supposed to or you gonna stick around and see the carnage i almost didnt have a choice before mrs mcclure could say two words about bryce or his basket shelly called ten then from the middle of the gym came twenty it was miranda humes with her hand way in the air they went back and forth back and forth higher and higher until shelly called sixtytwo i cant believe it i whispered to darla sixtytwo dollars cmon miranda come on i think shes out shellys got it sixtytwo dollars going once cried mrs mcclure but before she could say going twice a voice from the back of the gym called a hundred everyone gasped and turned around to see who had called the bid darla whispered its jenny atkinson i asked darla pointed right over there she was easy to spot standing tall above the others in the numberseven basketball jersey she almost always wore wow i whispered i had no idea maybe shell slamdunk him for you darla said with a grin who cares i giggled she slamdunked shelly mrs mcclure was gushing into the microphone about the recordbreaking bid when a big commotion broke out over by miranda i spotted shellys hair and my first thought was that there was going to be a fight but instead shelly and miranda turned to face mrs mcclure and called onetwentytwo fifty i choked down a cry what theyre teamin up darla whispered oh nonono i looked over jennys way come on jenny darla shook her head and said shes through and she was bryce went to shelly and miranda for one hundred twentytwo dollars and fifty cents it was a little strange meeting up with jon and walking over to the multipurpose room for lunch but he was just so nice and i think grateful that id bid that by the time we got situated at our table i wasnt feeling so awkward or silly it was just lunch things would have been easier if they hadnt seated me in direct view of bryce and his little harem but i did my best to ignore them jon told me all about this radiocontrolled airplane that he and his dad were building from scratch and how hed been working on it for nearly three months and that over the weekend they were finally going to get to try it out he told me a funny story about soldering the wires wrong and practically starting a fire in their basement and i asked him about how a radiocontrolled airplane works because i didnt really understand it so id relaxed a lot and was actually having a good time eating lunch with jon and i was so relieved that i hadnt bid on bryce what a fool i would have made of myself watching shelly and miranda fawning all over him didnt bother me nearly as much as i thought it would really they looked ridiculous jon asked about my family so i was telling him about my brothers and their band when a huge commotion broke out over at bryces table suddenly shelly and miranda were rolling on the floor like an enormous furball smearing each other with food out of nowhere bryce appeared at our table he grabbed my hand pulled me a few feet away and whispered do you like him i was stunned he held my other hand and asked again do you like him you mean jon yes i cant remember what i said he was looking into my eyes holding my hands tight and then he began pulling me toward him my heart was racing and his eyes were closing and his face was coming toward mine right there in front of all the other basket boys and their dates and the adults he was going to kiss me to kiss me i panicked id been waiting all my life for that kiss and now i yanked free and ran back to my table and when i sat down jon whispered did he just try to kiss you i turned my chair away from bryce and whispered can we please talk about something else anything else people were whispering and looking my way and when shelly stalls came back from cleaning up in the washroom everyone fell quiet her hair looked awful it was sort of oiled to her scalp and still had little chunks of food in it she glared at me so hard it looked like she was trying to get laser beams to shoot from her eyes a couple of adults steered her back to her seat and then everyone started whispering doublespeed and bryce didnt even seem to care he kept trying to come over and talk to me but either hed get intercepted by a teacher or id dash away from him before he had a chance to say anything when the dismissal bell finally rang i said a quick goodbye to jon and bolted out the door i couldnt reach my bike fast enough i was the first one off campus and i pedaled home so hard it felt as though my lungs would burst mrs stueby was out front watering her flower bed and she tried to say something to me but i just dropped my bike in the driveway and escaped into the house i certainly didnt want to talk about roosters my mother heard me slamming doors and came to check on me in my room julianna whats wrong i flipped over on my bed to face her and wailed i am so confused i dont know what to think or feel or do she sat down beside me on the bed and stroked my hair
